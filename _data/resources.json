                "description": "An incredible reference book covering all the basics of digital signal processing written by professors from MIT. You'll find here an in-depth explanation of concepts like the z-transform, FIR and IIR filters in their various forms, the discrete Fourier transform, and even a handy appendix reviewing the analog filters as a basis for IIR filter design. I do not plan to read it cover-to-cover but I do want to read some sections in full. Spread over 1000 pages, it contains all you need for computer music understanding and more.",

It covers a little bit wider area than \"Discrete-Time Signal Processing\" and focuses mostly on continuous-time signals (but not only). The most useful sections for audio programmers include the Fourier series, the Fourier transform, sampling, the Laplace transform, the z-transform, and signal modulation.",

As it a book accompanying a university course, it tries to explain things intuitively and show the reader various approaches to understanding filters. It shows the relation between the analog and the digital filters and provides a lot of helpful mathematics that underlie the two.",

                "description": "Although it may seem to be an old book, it explains the basic concepts of sound synthesis incredibly well. If you consider writing software to generate sound, I recommend starting with this book. It covers sampling, additive synthesis, wavetable synthesis, wave terrain synthesis, granular synthesis, subtractive synthesis, all types of modulation synthesis, and touches also on physical modeling, FOF (formant) synthesis, graphic synthesis, and stochastic synthesis. It also does a nice job of providing names of example works using the described techniques. Some additional useful parts deal with the MIDI protocol and digital signal processors' internals. I've read this book almost in full (I skipped the part on algorithmic composition) and I believe anyone can follow the presented material. There are few code listings and the maths used is very basic. For interested readers, the book contains very useful references albeit quite old ones.",

                "description": "A description of sound synthesis techniques from a user's perspective. What do all those knobs mean? There is no code and almost no mathematics inside. Nevertheless, the book is incredibly useful for audio programmers. Here you can find, for example, a thorough explanation of envelope types. There is also a little bit more on sampling than in the book by Curtis Roads. The conversational style of the book keeps you engaged throughout. I've read this one in full and I would do it again.",

This book is a real sound synthesis encyclopedia. It describes all synthesis techniques you could imagine and two novel methods developed by the author himself. As an educated physicist, violinist, and conductor, he definitely knows what he's writing about. I have only used the book for reference so far but I plan to read it in full soon.",
