I do not plan to read it cover-to-cover but I do want to read some sections in full. Spread over 1000 pages, it contains all you need for computer music understanding and more.",

It shows the relation between the analog and the digital filters and provides a lot of helpful mathematics that underlie the two.",

If you consider writing software to generate sound, I recommend starting with this book. It covers sampling, additive synthesis, wavetable synthesis, wave terrain synthesis, granular synthesis, subtractive synthesis, all types of modulation synthesis, and touches also on physical modeling, FOF (formant) synthesis, graphic synthesis, and stochastic synthesis. It also does a nice job of providing names of example music works using the described techniques. Some additional useful parts deal with the MIDI protocol and digital signal processors' internals. I've read this book almost in full (I skipped the part on algorithmic composition) and I believe anyone can follow the presented material. There are few code listings and the maths used is very basic. For interested readers, the book contains very useful references albeit quite old ones.",

On the accompanying website, you can find Jupyter Notebooks, sound examples, and exercises, which make the understanding even easier. I have read big portions of this book and I must admit that rarely any book is so clear in its mathematical notation. With that being said, you won't find here anything on audio effects or sound synthesis; this is pure music signal analysis.

Although not up-to-date with C++ 14 and later standards, it is a great read even for complete novices in C++ (thanks to the short but exhaustive \"tour of the language\" at the beginning of the book).
