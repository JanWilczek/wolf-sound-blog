                    "question": "Why are you eligible to teach audio programming?",
                    "answer": "I have graduated with distinction from Acoustic Engineering at AGH Unviersity of Science and Technology with the title of a Bachelor of Engineering. I then went on to obtain (also with distinction) the Master of Science in Advanced Signal Processing & Communications Engineering at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität in Erlangen-Nürnberg. I have also completed two years of Computer Science B. Eng. at the AGH UST. During my Bachelor studies I have worked for 1.5 years as an audio C++ developer at Techmo sp. z o. o. where I was developing Soundtoolkit, a sound spatialization engine for computer games. I also worked for 6 months in the Audio Processing Using Distributed Acoustic Sensors grant at the AGH UST, where I investigated the application of Nonnegative Tensor Factorization to the speech separation problem. At FAU in Germany, I worked for 6 months as a tutor of the Statistical Signal Processing laboratory. For my Master Thesis, I visited the Acoustic Lab of the Aalto University in Espoo, Finland. I worked there under Alec Wright, Vesa Välimäki, and my supervisor and mentor Emanuël Habets on a thesis entitled \"Virtual Analog Modeling of Audio Effects via Neural Ordinary Differential Equations\". We then extended the results of the thesis and published them on the Digital Audio FX 2022 conference in Vienna, Austria. Meanwhile, since December 2021 I have been working at Loudly GmbH based in Berlin, where I am the audio developer of the Music Maker JAM looping app for Windows, Android, and iOS. Since October 2019, I have been running the WolfSound blog and the YouTube channel deepening my knowledge and understanding of audio programming. If that doesn't convince you, then please, read through my articles on this blog and the videos on YouTube; trust me, you will find something interesting there!"

                    "answer": "No, you don't. However, I am not the kind of person, who will tell you that studies are a waste of time. On the contrary, I owe much to my university studies and if I had the choice again, I would probably go exactly the same route. What university environment gives you are the necessary basics to get started, knowledgeable people to ask for help, and fascinating people around you that can inspire you to do great things. The bits and pieces of knowledge from the university have helped me on numerous occasions. If you haven't studied audio programming or anything related, then you must seek your knowledge somewhere else. On WolfSound, I try to fill this gap in the internet resources concerning the common ground between Computer Science, Digital Signal Processing, and Music. All the resources that I personally find useful can be found on the <a href=\"/resources/\" target=\"_blank\">resources page</a>."
