### Minimum phase system

A linear, time-invariant system is minimum-phase if the system and its inverse are causal and stable. A digital minimum-phase system has all of the poles and zeros of its transfer function inside the unit circle of the $z$-plane.
The impulse response of a minimum-phase system has most of its energy concentrated in its initial part (that is vaguely said but intuitively understood).
