### Minimum phase system

A linear, time-invariant system is minimum-phase if the system and its inverse are causal and stable. A digital minimum-phase system has all of the poles and zeros of its transfer function inside the unit circle of the $z$-plane.
The impulse response of a minimum-phase system has most of its energy concentrated in its initial part (that is vaguely said but intuitively understood).

### Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM)

PCM samples is a fancy-sounding term for a very simple concept known to every audio programmer: sample values. However, it is used in the context of sampled analog signals. A PCM sample has

* a value: the instantaneous amplitude value of a sample (that's exactly the value that you can find in an audio buffer),
* a bit width: how many bits are used to represent a sample; these bits may be used to represent integer, fixed-point or floating-point samples; bit width and sample representation determine the quantization levels of a sample (which values a single sample can take)
* a sampling rate: at what rate the samples of the analog signal are taken at (the number of samples per second).

The name of this method originates from telephony, thus, it may be confusing to some.
