**Definition of Cookies**

Cookies are small text files sent to the user's browser by a website they are visiting at a given moment. These files allow the website to remember information about the pages visited by the user, including our website. This enables a smoother and more tailored browsing experience based on the user's needs and preferences. Cookies used for functional purposes provide access to key features of the service, such as preferences (e.g., the user's selected language), session-related information (e.g., the contents of a shopping cart in an online store), or optimizations that help maintain and improve the service's functionality.

We also protect user privacy within the scope of cookies – more details are available in the **Privacy Policy** section. Users can decide which cookies can be used. Management of this aspect is possible through the browser settings or directly on the visited website.

In addition, we use similar technologies, such as pixels, plugins, tags, and web beacons, collectively referred to as "cookies."

Based on their lifecycle, cookies are classified into:

- **Session cookies**: Deleted when the web browser is closed.
- **Persistent cookies**: Deleted after a predetermined period, regardless of the browser's closure.

Based on the domain they originate from, cookies are categorized as:

- **First-party cookies**: Set by our web servers.
- **Third-party cookies**: Set by the web servers of other websites.

**Functions of Cookies**

In addition to the functions mentioned above, cookies are also used for security purposes, such as preventing fraud, authenticating users, and protecting them during service use (e.g., when making purchases). Cookies help ensure that only the account owner has access and that their data remains encrypted.

Cookies also assist in collecting data that adapts the services to the user’s usage patterns. This data helps improve the content and features of the services to enhance user experience.

Cookies may also be set by us or our advertising partners through our website (**targeting cookies**). These cookies may be used to build a profile of the user's interests and display relevant advertisements on our or third-party websites. They do not store personal data directly but rely on the unique identification of the user's browser and internet device. If the user opts out of these cookies, they will experience fewer targeted advertisements.

**Social media cookies** (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) are used on our websites to enable functionalities like logging in, liking, sharing content, or showing users ads when they visit social media platforms. Personal data is processed by social media platforms according to their privacy policies, available on their respective websites.

Cookies are also used for **personalization**, **functionality testing**, and **performance improvement** (**functional and performance cookies**). Personalized features and content include more relevant search results and recommendations, enhancing the user's experience when visiting the website and tailoring search results to their previous interests. Performance cookies allow us to monitor traffic on our sites, thereby improving their efficiency and user experience.

Apart from the cookies listed above, which are mostly not essential for using our site but significantly enhance user experience and comfort, there are also cookies crucial for proper site functionality. Disabling or restricting these cookies may prevent us from delivering certain services.
