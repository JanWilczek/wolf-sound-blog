Currently, I am a student of Elite Masterâ€™s Programme Advanced Signal Processing & Communications Engineering at Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nurnberg. When not busy with university duties I spend time reading and learning about software programming and entrepreneurship. Every day I try to learn and grow as much as possible drawing not only from books but mainly from relationships.
