Welcome to the Wolf Sound! Thank You for being here.

My name is Jan Wilczek and I have created Wolf Sound to be able to share my passion of audio programming.

On Wolf Sound you can expect three types of activity (the &#8216;pillars&#8217; of the brand):

  * **Knowledge:** videos, articles, courses, books, podcasts etc. concerning the topic of sound programming. My primal area of interests are sound synthesis and music effects programming, but the topics will cover a much wider ground (although always connected to sound, or programming, or both). I want to share my knowledge, but I also want to learn from You-Your suggestions and tips are always welcomed! The following areas are considered significant:
      * sound synthesis
      * sound effects (e.g. filters, reverb, compression)
      * digital signal processing (DSP)
      * algorithmic composition
      * music processing
      * sound application programming interfaces (APIs)
      * different programming languages and their application to audio processing
      * listening conditions
      * computer games audio
      * human hearing
  * **Products:** I am developing my own sound synthesisers for commercial release, but there are other projects on the horizon, so definitely stick around for some Digital Audio Workstation plug-ins and more!
  * **Services:** consulting, leading seminars, carrying out audio programming tasks on demand; all for the greater good of audio!

See You around on TheWolfSound.com! Don&#8217;t forget to visit and subscribe to the official [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZuWJuoBe046gMqmYcc7Qww)!
