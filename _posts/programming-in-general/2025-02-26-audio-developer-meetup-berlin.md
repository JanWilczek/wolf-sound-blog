An exciting opportunity in Berlin!

You have a cool hobby: audio programming.

You code your stuff, you put it out on GitHub, you make awesome sounds.

But it feels lonely at times, doesn't it?

Wouldn't it be nice to be able to spend an afternoon every now and then to chat with other people about audio development?

Where to talk to fellow audio developers in your neighborhood?

Well, now there's a chance you can...

**Fabian Renn-Giles** (JUCE, Apple, The Sphere, [guest of WolfTalk podcast episode 21]({% post_url collections.posts, '2024-05-20-fabian-renn-giles.md' %})) together with **Rachel Susser** (Apple, Ableton) created [**Audio Developer Meetup Berlin**](https://www.meetup.com/en-US/audio-developer-meetup-berlin/).

It's an exciting new opportunity for audio developers (not just C++) as well as DSP people to showcase their work, exchange knowledge, and network (which I believe is one of the core activities an aspiring audio programmer should do).

Given that speakers have already been Astrid Bin and Timur Doumler, this is a top-notch experience.

Oh, and did I say that it's **enitrely free**?

So grab your U-Bahn, S-Bahn, train or plane and to go to Berlin!

The upcoming meetup dates in 2025 are (subject to change, of course):

- 8th April
- 6th May
- 3rd June
- 1st July
- 5th August
- 9th September
- 7th October
- 4th November
- 2nd December

If you want to be notified separaterly from meetup.com notifications, then [**subscribe to the WolfSound newsletter.**]({% link collections.all, 'newsletter.md' %}) WolfSound is the official media partner of the meetup so I'll gladly notify you about upcoming meetings.

I hope to be there too in person once or twice so if we meet, let's talk! This meetup is the closest audio-related thing to my home since the Audio Developer Conference constantly refuses to move to Berlin (maybe 2026? Fingers crossed! üòâ)

Do you know of other opportunities in your area to meet with fellow audio developers and DSP enthusiasts? Let everyone know in the comments below! ‚¨áÔ∏è
