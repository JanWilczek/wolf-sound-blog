Let's meet in Berlin!

I will be speaking at the upcoming Audio Developer Meetup in Berlin on January 13, 2026.

I'll show you how to develop your audio programming skills while helping others and increasing your competitive advantage on the job market.

[You can sign up to attend here.](https://www.meetup.com/audio-developer-meetup-berlin/events/312195518/?eventOrigin=group_featured_event)

At the event, there will also be a talk by [Oli Larkin]({% post_url collections.posts, '2023-11-09-oliver-larkin.md' %}) on iPlug3, which is very exciting!

I'd be happy to chat with you after the event over pizza 🍕

Audio Developer Meetup is organized by Rachel Susser and [Fabian Renn-Giles]({% post_url collections.posts, '2024-05-20-fabian-renn-giles.md' %}). Thank you both for doing this for the community!

And to you dear reader, see you in Berlin!
