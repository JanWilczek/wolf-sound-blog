## Introduction

Welcome to the 4th part of the Android wavetable synthesizer app tutorial!

In this tutorial series, we want to design and implement a synthesizer app on Android using all the modern technologies and best practices.

In theÂ [first part of this tutorial]({% post_url collections.posts, 'synthesis/android-wavetable-synthesizer/2022-08-02-app-architecture' %}), we discussed the architecture of our app.

In theÂ [second part of this tutorial]({% post_url collections.posts, 'synthesis/android-wavetable-synthesizer/2022-08-10-ui' %}), we discussed how to create its user interface (UI) using Jetpack Compose.

## Why Do We Need to Call C++ Code For Audio Processing?

You may be wondering why we cannot simply do the audio processing in Kotlin or Java.

We could if our processing was very basic. However, audio processing is most efficient if integrated directly with the audio driver. Furthermore, audio processing runs most efficiently if compiled directly to the machine code. These both properties exclude Java or Kotlin from the group of considered languages.

From [Google Security Blog](https://security.googleblog.com/2021/04/rust-in-android-platform.html):

> Lower levels of the OS require systems programming languages like C, C++, and Rust. These languages are designed with control and predictability as goals. They provide access to low level system resources and hardware. They are light on resources and have more predictable performance characteristics.

Currently, it is easiest to write Android audio code in C++ thanks to the [Oboe](https://github.com/google/oboe) library (which we will introduce in the next part of the tutorial).

<!-- TODO: Link to the next part. -->

But who knows, maybe it will soon be easier in Rust ðŸ˜‰

## How Can We Call C++ Code From Kotlin?

Thanks to the Java/Kotlin interoperability, it is quite easy to call C or C++ functions from Kotlin.

For this, we need 2 parts:

- `external` functions in Kotlin, and
- Java Native Interface (JNI) bridge.

**External functions** in Kotlin are functions which are declared in Kotlin modules and can be called in Kotlin but which are defined in C or C++ code. This concept is similar to header file/source file separation in C and C++. You may also think about the `extern` keyword in C/C++, which specifies that a global variable, a function, or a template declaration has *external linkage*.

**Java Native Interface** is a programming framework that allows a programmer to call C/C++ functions from Java and Java methods from C/C++.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to call C/C++ functions from Kotlin using these two components.

To call C++ code from Kotlin you need to:

1. Define the desired functions in a Kotlin module as `external` functions.
2. Create a source C++ file.
3. Write the definitions of the previously declared functions in C++ using appropriate function signatures defined by JNI.
4. Create a build script for the C++ file. This is typically a *CMakeLists.txt* file with a shared library target.
5. Adjust the *build.gradle* script file.
6. Load the shared C++ library statically in Kotlin.

As this seems quite complex, the best thing we can do is to go through this process step by step ðŸ˜Ž

## NativeWavetableSynthesizer Class

The first thing that weâ€™ll do is to implement the Kotlin side of things. That means creating a class that implements the `WavetableSynthesizer` interface from the previous video and redirects the calls to its methods to the native (C++) code. This class will be called `NativeWavetableSynthesizer` class.

As a reminder, here is the `WavetableSynthesizer` interface from *WavetableSynthesizer.kt*.

_Listing {% increment listingId20221009 %}._
```kotlin
interface WavetableSynthesizer {
  suspend fun play()
  suspend fun stop()
  suspend fun isPlaying() : Boolean
  suspend fun setFrequency(frequencyInHz: Float)
  suspend fun setVolume(volumeInDb: Float)
  suspend fun setWavetable(wavetable: Wavetable)
}
```

### Package and Import Instructions

To control the native object, `NativeWavetableSynthesizer` must also be lifecycle-aware. Here is the package and import instructions along with the class declaration.

_Listing {% increment listingId20221009 %}._
```kotlin
package com.thewolfsound.wavetablesynthesizer

import android.util.Log
import androidx.lifecycle.*
import kotlinx.coroutines.Dispatchers
import kotlinx.coroutines.withContext

class NativeWavetableSynthesizer : WavetableSynthesizer, DefaultLifecycleObserver {
```

To use the `DefaultLifecycleObserver`, we must add an additional dependency to our *app/build.gradle* file:

```gradle
dependencies {
  //...
  implementation "androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-viewmodel-compose:2.5.0"
}
```

### Native Object Handle and External Functions

In Listing 3, there are member variables and functions listed that are directly connected with the native code.

_Listing {% increment listingId20221009 %}._
```kotlin
private var synthesizerHandle: Long = 0
private val synthesizerMutex = Object()
private external fun create(): Long
private external fun delete(synthesizerHandle: Long)
private external fun play(synthesizerHandle: Long)
private external fun stop(synthesizerHandle: Long)
private external fun isPlaying(synthesizerHandle: Long): Boolean
private external fun setFrequency(synthesizerHandle: Long, frequencyInHz: Float)
private external fun setVolume(synthesizerHandle: Long, amplitudeInDb: Float)
private external fun setWavetable(synthesizerHandle: Long, wavetable: Int)
```

`synthesizerHandle` holds the memory address under which the native C++ object is located. As C++ does not have a garbage collector, this object must be explicitly destroyed and its memory freed when its lifetime ends.

`synthesizerMutex` controls the access to the `synthesizerHandle` so that it is not modified concurrently.

All the functions declared as `external` will be implemented in the C++ code. Since they are functions rather than methods, we need to explicitly pass in the pointer to the native object to use it in the native code. We can also pass in additional arguments and obtain return values.

### Native Library-Loading Code

To use a native C++ code from Kotlin, we need to load a shared library in the `static` block of our class.

Since Kotlin does not have a `static` block, we must use its equivalent: the `init` block of a `companion object`.

*Note: Although there are a few differences, you may think of members declared inside of a `companion object` as declared with the `static` keyword from Java.*

In Listing 4, itâ€™s shown how to load our native synthesizer library.

_Listing {% increment listingId20221009 %}._
```kotlin
companion object {
  init {
    System.loadLibrary("wavetablesynthesizer")
  }
}
```

### Lifecycle-Aware Methods

Since `NativeWavetableSynthesizer` needs to know when it should destroy its native object and we generally should avoid the usage of `finalize()`, we need a way to be notified when the native synthesizer object may be needed and when not anymore.

For this, weâ€™ll make the `NativeWavetableSynthesizer` lifecycle-aware, meaning that its parent (in this case, `MainActivity`) will notify it analogously to the lifecycle methods of the `Activity` classes in Android.

In this case, we want to construct the native synthesizer when the user opens the app screen ("resumes" the app) and destroy the native synthesizer when the user leaves the app screen ("pauses" the app). These events are signaled with `onResume()` and `onPause()` methods of the `LifecycleObserver` accordingly.

_Listing {% increment listingId20221009 %}._
```kotlin
override fun onResume(owner: LifecycleOwner) {
  super.onResume(owner)

  synchronized(synthesizerMutex){
    Log.d("NativeWavetableSynthesizer", "onResume() called")
    createNativeHandleIfNotExists()
  }
}

override fun onPause(owner: LifecycleOwner) {
  super.onPause(owner)

  synchronized(synthesizerMutex) {
    Log.d("NativeWavetableSynthesizer", "onPause() called")

    if (synthesizerHandle == 0L) {
      Log.e("NativeWavetableSynthesizer", "Attempting to destroy a null synthesizer.")
      return
    }

    // Destroy the synthesizer
    delete(synthesizerHandle)
    synthesizerHandle = 0L
  }
}

private fun createNativeHandleIfNotExists() {
  if (synthesizerHandle != 0L) {
    return
  } 

  // create the synthesizer
  synthesizerHandle = create()
}
```

`onResume()` method uses a simple helper function that creates the native object if it is not created already.

`createNativeHandleIfNotExists()` checks if the memory address pointing to the native object is different from 0 (i.e., the object exists). If it does, then the method returns.

If the native object does not exist, the `create()` external function is called, which creates the native object and returns its memory address. We will implement `create()` in the C++ code later on. We store the returned handle to be able to access the native object and eventually destroy it.

`onPause()` method destroys the native synthesizer only if it exists (`synthesizerHandle` is different from 0). To this end, the `delete()` external function is called and the objectâ€™s memory address handle is zeroed. `delete()` will be implemented later in C++.

### WavetableSynthesizer Methods Implementation

Listing 6 shows the implementation of the `WavetableSynthesizer` interface methods.

_Listing {% increment listingId20221009 %}._
```kotlin
override suspend fun play() = withContext(Dispatchers.Default){
  synchronized(synthesizerMutex){
    createNativeHandleIfNotExists()
    play(synthesizerHandle)
  }
}

override suspend fun stop() = withContext(Dispatchers.Default){
  synchronized(synthesizerMutex){
    createNativeHandleIfNotExists()
    stop(synthesizerHandle)
  }
}

override suspend fun isPlaying(): Boolean = withContext(Dispatchers.Default){
  synchronized(synthesizerMutex){
    createNativeHandleIfNotExists()
    return@withContext isPlaying(synthesizerHandle)
  }
}

override suspend fun setFrequency(frequencyInHz: Float) = withContext(Dispatchers.Default){
  synchronized(synthesizerMutex){
    createNativeHandleIfNotExists()
    setFrequency(synthesizerHandle, frequencyInHz)
  }
}

override suspend fun setVolume(volumeInDb: Float) = withContext(Dispatchers.Default){
  synchronized(synthesizerMutex){
    createNativeHandleIfNotExists()
    setVolume(synthesizerHandle, volumeInDb)
  }
}

override suspend fun setWavetable(wavetable: Wavetable) = withContext(Dispatchers.Default){
  synchronized(synthesizerMutex){
    createNativeHandleIfNotExists()
    setWavetable(synthesizerHandle, wavetable.ordinal)
  }
}
```

Each method:

1. Takes the mutex that protects the native handle.
2. Creates the synthesizer if it does not exist.
3. Calls the corresponding native function.

All these calls happen in the `Default` execution context of Kotlin coroutines (remember that the `WavetableSynthesizer` interface marked its methods as suspended so that we can use coroutines not to block the UI thread).

The `Default` dispatcher uses a thread pool of JVM threads to dispatch the given operation. Thanks to it, we move the execution of the methods of `NativeWavetableSynthesizer` to other threads than the main (UI) thread and, thus, not block the UI (and cause an "App not responding" message). 

You may be wondering:

1. Why do we need to use the mutex at all?
2. Why do we need to check if the synthesizer exists? Shouldnâ€™t `onResume()` and `onPause()` suffice?

The answer to question number 1 is relatively straightforward: we want to make sure that the synthesizer is not destroyed while we are still doing some operations on it. Otherwise, we may attempt to use an already freed part of memory what will result in heap corruption or worse.

The answer to question number 2 is somewhat funny though: I found in my tests that sometimes chaotic things happen at app startup and so some methods may be called when the synthesizer is not constructed. It sounds weird, I knowâ€¦ If you happen to think of a better solution, just let me know ðŸ˜‰

## Native C++ Code

After preparing the Kotlin part, we may now proceed to the C++ part.

For now, we will not implement any audio features; we merely want to check that our code works. For this, we will build a native analog of the `LoggingWavetableSynthesizer` ; each C++ function will simply log that it has been called and print its argumentsâ€™ values.

Alongside the *java* folder in your app module, we will create a *cpp* folder with a *wavetablesynthesizer-native-lib.cpp* and *CMakeLists.txt* files.

The easiest way to do it is to right-click your app module in the Android Studioâ€™s "Android" project view and click "Add C++ To Module" and then "OK".

<div markdown="0">
<img class="lazyload" data-src="{{ images | append: "/AddCppToModule.webp" }}" alt="Add C++ To Module option of Android Studio">
</div>

_Figure {% increment figureId20221009 %}. "Add C++ To Module" option of Android Studio._

You can then rename the created *test.cpp* file to *wavetablesynthesizer-native-lib.cpp* but everything else will be handled for you.

Weâ€™re ready to start developing the C++ code on Android!

## wavetablesynthesizer-native-lib.cpp

In the *wavetablesynthesizer-native-lib.cpp*, we will put the implementation of the methods previously declared as `external`.

### Included headers

Listing 7 shows the included headers and the `extern "C" {` linkage specification.

_Listing {% increment listingId20221009 %}._
```cpp
#include <jni.h>
#include <memory>
#include "Log.h"
#include "WavetableSynthesizer.h"

extern "C" {
```

*jni.h* header is provided by Androidâ€™s Native Development Kit (NDK). The *memory* header is needed for using `std::make_unique`. *Log.h* contains the `LOGD` logging macro and will be created by us later on in this tutorial. *WavetableSynthesizer.h* header contains the definition of the `WavetableSynthesizer` C++ class, which we will also shortly create.

Finally, `extern "C"` linkage specification states that the functions declared in the following scope have **C linkage**, i.e., they can be called from the C language. That enforces some constraints on the C++ compiler and allows the functions to be used with JNI.

### create() Function

Listing 8 shows the implementation of the `create()` function.

The `create()` function creates the `WavetableSynthesizer` C++ class from the `wavetablesynthesizer` namespace. We use `make_unique` to ensure proper destruction in case of an exception (thatâ€™s a good practice to follow).

_Listing {% increment listingId20221009 %}._
```cpp
JNIEXPORT jlong JNICALL
Java_com_thewolfsound_wavetablesynthesizer_NativeWavetableSynthesizer_create(
    JNIEnv* env,
    jobject obj) {
  auto synthesizer =
      std::make_unique<wavetablesynthesizer::WavetableSynthesizer>();

  if (not synthesizer) {
    LOGD("Failed to create the synthesizer.");
    synthesizer.reset(nullptr);
  }

  return reinterpret_cast<jlong>(synthesizer.release());
}
```

After the synthesizer has been constructed we check if the construction succeeded. If not, we use the `LOGD` macro to log the failure and ensure that the `synthesizer` unique pointer does not contain a value other than `nullptr`. Finally, we return the address of the allocated object by releasing the ownership of the synthesizer (so that it is not destroyed after returning from `create()`) and casting it to a `jlong` value understood by Java and Kotlin. This value is used as a native handle in the calling Kotlin class.

Take a moment to look at the signature of this function. It consists of the following elements:

1. `JNIEXPORT` declaration,
2. return type,
3. `JNICALL` specification,
4. name of the `external` function specified as `Java_package_name_KotlinClassName_functionName`; if we get that right, Android Studio should display it in a more friendly format,
5. arguments:
    1. `JNIEnv` object, which gives us access to the Java Virtual Machine interface,
    2. `jobject` which points to the object calling the native function,
    3. any other arguments passed to the function. `create()` does not have any arguments so there are no more arguments than the 2 above.

The signatures of these functions are crucial; if we make a mistake, JVM will fail to call the correct function.

### delete() Function

Listing 9 shows the `delete()` function which destroys the native synthesizer object.

_Listing {% increment listingId20221009 %}._
```cpp
JNIEXPORT void JNICALL
Java_com_thewolfsound_wavetablesynthesizer_NativeWavetableSynthesizer_delete(
    JNIEnv* env,
    jobject obj,
    jlong synthesizerHandle) {
  auto* synthesizer =
      reinterpret_cast<wavetablesynthesizer::WavetableSynthesizer*>(
          synthesizerHandle);

  if (not synthesizer) {
    LOGD("Attempt to destroy an unitialized synthesizer.");
    return;
  }

  delete synthesizer;
}
```

The first line of this function is the most important. It contains a recipe on how to retrieve a pointer to the native object from a `jlong` argument. If the casting fails, we log the failure and return from the function; there isnâ€™t anything more we can do. Otherwise, we call the destructor and free the memory occupied by the object by using the `delete` keyword.

### Remaining Functions

All the remaining functions are rather straightforward. They

1. Retrieve the pointer to the native object as in the `delete()` function.
2. (Optionally: adjust the arguments to have correct types, for example, cast `jfloat` to `float`).
3. Check if the synthesizer exists: if it does, they call the appropriate function. Otherwise, they log the failure and return, sometimes with a default return value.

_Listing {% increment listingId20221009 %}._
```cpp
JNIEXPORT void JNICALL
Java_com_thewolfsound_wavetablesynthesizer_NativeWavetableSynthesizer_play(
    JNIEnv* env,
    jobject obj,
    jlong synthesizerHandle) {
  auto* synthesizer =
      reinterpret_cast<wavetablesynthesizer::WavetableSynthesizer*>(

  } else {

  }
}

    auto* synthesizer =
            reinterpret_cast<wavetablesynthesizer::WavetableSynthesizer*>(
                    synthesizerHandle);
    const auto nativeWavetable = static_cast<wavetablesynthesizer::Wavetable>(wavetable);

    if (synthesizer) {
        synthesizer->setWavetable(nativeWavetable);
    } else {
        LOGD(
                "Synthesizer not created. Please, create the synthesizer first by "
                "calling create().");
    }
}
} // extern "C"
```

## WavetableSynthesizer C++ Class

The C++ `WavetableSynthesizer` class mirrors the `WavetableSynthesizer` interface (well, because it is its implementation via the `NativeWavetableSynthesizer`). Therefore, its class declaration (in file *app/src/main/cpp/include/WavetableSynthesizer.h*) should not come as a surprise.

It is shown in Listing 11.

_Listing {% increment listingId20221009 %}._
```cpp
#pragma once

namespace wavetablesynthesizer {
enum class Wavetable {
  SINE, TRIANGLE, SQUARE, SAW
};

class WavetableSynthesizer {
public:
  void play();
  void stop();
  bool isPlaying();
  void setFrequency(float frequencyInHz);
  void setVolume(float volumeInDb);
  void setWavetable(Wavetable wavetable);

private:
  bool _isPlaying = false;
};
}
```

The only point worth mentioning here is that we need to define the `Wavetable` enum again, which is bad in the sense that now we have 2 definitions (one in Kotlin and one in C++), which **must** be equivalent.

A solution to this would be to define `Wavetable` in a separate file and have the Kotlin and C++ definitions generated before the compilation. However, this would be an overkill for this tutorial and so weâ€™ll stick to this simplified, error-prone version.

Listing 12 shows the implementation of the member functions from the header file in the *app/src/main/cpp/WavetableSynthesizer.cpp* file.

_Listing {% increment listingId20221009 %}._
```cpp
#include "Log.h"
#include "WavetableSynthesizer.h"

namespace wavetablesynthesizer {
bool WavetableSynthesizer::isPlaying() {
  LOGD("isPlaying() called.");
  return _isPlaying;
}

void WavetableSynthesizer::play() {
  LOGD("play() called.");
  _isPlaying = true;
}

void WavetableSynthesizer::setFrequency(float frequencyInHz) {
  LOGD("Frequency set to %.2f Hz.", frequencyInHz);
}

void WavetableSynthesizer::setVolume(float volumeInDb) {
  LOGD("Volume set to %.2f dBFS.", volumeInDb);
}

void WavetableSynthesizer::setWavetable(Wavetable wavetable) {
  LOGD("Wavetable set to %d.", static_cast<int>(wavetable));
}

void WavetableSynthesizer::stop() {
  LOGD("stop() called.");
  _isPlaying = false;
}
} // namespace wavetablesynthesizer
```

As you can see, each method simply logs that it was called and what argument had been passed in. Iâ€™ve also implemented the "is playing" state to maintain coherency with the UI.

## Log.h header

The *Log.h* header in *app/src/main/cpp/include* folder (Listing 13) provides a simple macro for logging to the Logcat of Android Studio. It is a useful tool for debugging because using a debugger in Android Studio significantly increases the CPU and RAM utilization and may be inadequate in a multithreaded code.

The macro is disabled in release builds not to slow down the app (logging can take quite a bit of time). This is controlled using the `NDEBUG` constant, which is only defined in release builds.

_Listing {% increment listingId20221009 %}._
```cpp
#pragma once

#include <android/log.h>

#ifndef NDEBUG
#define LOGD(args...) \
__android_log_print(android_LogPriority::ANDROID_LOG_DEBUG, "WavetableSynthesizer", args)
#else
#define LOGD(args...)
#endif
```

*android/log.h* header contains the `__android_log_print` function, which takes a log priority constant as its first argument, a label as the second argument, a format string (familiar from the `printf` function), and its arguments (which may vary in count). The `LOGD` macro can accept a variable number of arguments, the first of which should be the format string. It Instead of writing a long call to `__android_log_print`, we can simply use the macro (and automatically turn it off in release builds!).

Logging requires us to link against a native `log` library of Android NDK. That will be done in the *CMakeLists.txt* file, which we will edit next.

## CMakeLists.txt File

CMake is a build system for C/C++ projects that is highly flexible, widely adopted, and cross-platform. It has a few other characteristics (open-source, etc.) but the three above are the most important for me.

Itâ€™s awesome that Android supports CMake because that allows us to compile our C++ library outside of the Android environment (if we wanted to) using the same build file.

As various build systems have various build scripts, CMake uses the *CMakeLists.txt* file.

Our current *CMakeLists.txt* file resides in *app/src/main/cpp* folder and is very simple, as shown in Listing 14. Most of the comments are automatically generated by Android Studio; I left them for your convenience.

_Listing {% increment listingId20221009 %}._
```cmake
# Sets the minimum version of CMake required to build the native library.
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.18.1)

# Declares and names the project.
project("wavetablesynthesizer")

# Creates and names a library, sets it as SHARED, 
# and provides the relative paths to its source code.
# Gradle automatically packages shared libraries with your APK.
# To use the library from Kotlin, we must set it as shared.
add_library( # Sets the name of the library.
             wavetablesynthesizer

             # Sets the library as a shared library.
             SHARED

             # Provides a relative path to your source file(s).
             wavetablesynthesizer-native-lib.cpp
             WavetableSynthesizer.cpp
        )

# Specifies the location of the header files
# where the C++ compiler can find them
include_directories(
        include
)

# Searches for a specified prebuilt library and stores the path as a
# variable. Because CMake includes system libraries in the search path by
# default, you only need to specify the name of the public NDK library
# you want to add. CMake verifies that the library exists before
# completing its build.
find_library( # Sets the name of the path variable.
              log-lib

              # Specifies the name of the NDK library that
              # you want CMake to locate.
              log )

# Specifies libraries CMake should link to your target library. You
# can link multiple libraries, such as libraries you define in this
# build script, prebuilt third-party libraries, or system libraries.
target_link_libraries( # Specifies the target library.
                       wavetablesynthesizer

                       # Links the target library to the log library
					   # (found with find_library)
                       # included in the NDK.
                       ${log-lib} )
```

## Appâ€™s build.gradle Adjustments

After using the "Add C++ to Module" option of Android Studio, your app moduleâ€™s *build.gradle* file should have been adjusted properly. Below, in Listing 15, I have listed the changes that should have appeared there. The additions invoke the build of the native library before building the app.

_Listing {% increment listingId20221009 %}._
```gradle

android{
  // ...
  defaultConfig {
  // ...
    externalNativeBuild{
      cmake{
        cppFlags ''
      }
    }
  }
  // ...
  externalNativeBuild{
    cmake{
      path file('src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt')
      version '3.18.1'
    }
  }
}
```

To enable the C++ 20 standard, you can change this line

_Listing {% increment listingId20221009 %}._
```gradle
cppFlags ''
```

into this line

_Listing {% increment listingId20221009 %}._
```gradle
cppFlags '-std=c++2a'
```

Now, your native code should compile just fine.

## MainActivity.kt Adjustments

The last thing we need to do is to adjust the `MainActivity` class so that we use the `NativeWavetableSynthesizer` instead of the `LoggingWavetableSynthesizer`.

Since our `MainActivity` class is really small, I will simply paste here the whole code (Listing 18).

_Listing {% increment listingId20221009 %}._
```kotlin
class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {

  // Changed: instantiate the synthesizer using C++
  private val synthesizer = NativeWavetableSynthesizer()

  private val synthesizerViewModel: WavetableSynthesizerViewModel by viewModels()

  override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    requestedOrientation = ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE

    // Added: add the synthesizer as a lifecycle observer
    lifecycle.addObserver(synthesizer)

    synthesizerViewModel.wavetableSynthesizer = synthesizer
    setContent{
      WavetableSynthesizerTheme{
        Surface(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
                color = MaterialTheme.colors.background){
          WavetableSynthesizerApp(Modifier, synthesizerViewModel)
        }
      }
    }
  }

  override fun onDestroy() {
    super.onDestroy()

    // Added: remove the synthesizer as a lifecycle observer on destruction
    lifecycle.removeObserver(synthesizer)
  }

  override fun onResume() {
    super.onResume()
    synthesizerViewModel.applyParameters()
  }
}
```

The changes since [the last part]({% post_url collections.posts, 'synthesis/android-wavetable-synthesizer/2022-09-11-view-model' %}) are:

1. `LoggingWavetableSynthesizer` instantiation has been replaced by `NativeWavetableSynthesizer` instantiation.
2. The synthesizer is added as a lifecycle observer in `onCreate()` and removed in `onDestroy()`. This will ensure that the `onResume()` and `onPause()` methods of `NativeWavetableSynthesizer` will be called by `MainActivity`.

## Testing

When you now build and run the app, you should be able to see the log messages appearing in the Logcat but this time coming from the C++ `WavetableSynthesizer` class rather than from the Kotlin `LoggingWavetableSynthesizer` class.

In the next parts of the tutorial, we will remove this dummy implementation and finally hear something! But first, we need to write code to connect to Androidâ€™s audio driverâ€¦ Which will be the topic of the next part!

## Summary

In this part of the Android wavetable synthesizer tutorial, we have learned how to call C++ code from Kotlin on Android.

Specifically, we learned

1. what are `external` functions in Kotlin,
2. how to use Java Native Interface with Kotlin,
3. how to log to Logcat from C++ code,
4. how to compile native libraries for Android using CMake and Gradle, and
5. how to handle the construction and destruction of native objects from managed code.

Up next: connecting to Android audio from C++ using the Oboe library!
