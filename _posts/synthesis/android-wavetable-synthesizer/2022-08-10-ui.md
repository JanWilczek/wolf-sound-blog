Learn how to create the UI for Android apps!

## Introduction

In the [previous article]({% post_url synthesis/android-wavetable-synthesizer/2022-08-02-app-architecture.md %}), we set the goals of our project. The main goal is to build a wavetable synthesizer Android app. A secondary goal is to learn modern Android technologies along the way.

Today, we will learn the first of these technologies, namely, **Jetpack Compose**.

## What Is Jetpack Compose?

**Jetpack Compose is a modern (as of 2022) framework for building the user interface (UI) for Android apps.**

Which framework is not modern anymore then? Well, everything before Compose so views and layouts.

What's changed?

1. We don't have to use XML files anymore.
2. Gone are `findViewById` and the like.
3. All the UI code is simply Kotlin code not XML.

## What Are The Benefits of Using Jetpack Compose?

The benefits of the new framework in my opinion are

1. **No need to learn a dedicated language (i.e., Android XML schemas).** Everything stays in Kotlin.
2. **Easier interaction of app code with the UI.** For example, we can use conditional statements to display parts of the UI or not.
3. **Previews are also generated with code.** No need to delve into some preview manager.

## What are the Drawbacks of Using Jetpack Compose?

Well, in my opinion, there are three:

1. **You have to learn a new framework.** That's why I created this tutorial for you ðŸ˜‰
2. **You can throw your knowledge of the previous framework into trash.** Unless, you work with the now-legacy views.
3. **You need to rewrite your UI to stay up to date.** For any more complicated app, that's a significant headache.

After complaining, we can now proceed to actually learning Jetpack Compose!

## How Does Jetpack Compose Work?

Jetpack Compose, like most of the UI frameworks (including HTML), is hierarchical.

The UI in Compose is built of **composables**.

Each composable consists of zero or more composables.
