## Introduction

In the [previous article]({% post_url collections.posts, 'synthesis/android-wavetable-synthesizer/2022-08-02-app-architecture' %}), we set the goals of our project. The main goal is to build a wavetable synthesizer Android app. A secondary goal is to learn modern Android technologies and best practices along the way.

Today, we will learn the first of these technologies, namely, **Jetpack Compose**.

As usual, the full source code is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/JanWilczek/android-wavetable-synthesizer).

## What Is Jetpack Compose?

**Jetpack Compose is a modern (as of 2022) framework for building the user interface (UI) of Android apps.**

Which framework is not modern anymore then? Well, everything before Compose so views and layouts.

What's changed?

1. We don't have to use XML files anymore.
2. Gone are `findViewById` and the like.
3. All the UI code is simply Kotlin code not XML.

     data-ad-slot="7289385396"></ins><script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>

## What Are the Benefits of Using Jetpack Compose?

The benefits of the new framework, in my opinion, are

1. **No need to learn a dedicated language (i.e., Android XML schemas).** Everything stays in Kotlin.
2. **Easier interaction of app code with the UI.** For example, we can use conditional statements to display parts of the UI or not directly in the UI code.
3. **Previews are also generated with code.** No need to delve into some preview manager.

## What Are the Drawbacks of Using Jetpack Compose?

Well, in my opinion, there are three:

1. **You have to learn a new framework.** That's why I created this tutorial for you ðŸ˜‰
2. **You can throw your knowledge of the previous framework into trash.** Unless, you work with the now-legacy views.
3. **You need to rewrite your UI to stay up to date.** For any more complicated app, that's a significant headache.

After complaining, we can now proceed to actually learning Jetpack Compose!

## How Does Jetpack Compose Work?

Jetpack Compose, like most of the UI frameworks (including HTML), is hierarchical.

The UI in Compose is built of **composables**.

Each composable consists of zero or more composables.

<div markdown="0">
<img class="lazyload" data-src="{{ images | absolute_url | append: "/composables.svg" }}" alt="Composables nested into one another" width="60%">
</div>

_Figure {% increment figureId20220810 %}. Composables are nested within each other building hierarchies._

By *composing composables* we can create any arbitrarily complex UI.

### What Are Composables?

Composables are simply Kotlin functions.

Within these functions we define what's inside of our composables.

_Listing {% increment listingId20220810  %}_
```kotlin
@Composable
fun SomeComposable(
   modifier: Modifier = Modifier
) {
   Column(
       horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally,
       modifier = modifier
   ) {
       Image(
           //..
       )
       Text(
           //..
       )
   }
}
```

At the lowest level of the code written by developers, the composables contain the composable delivered by the Compose framework such as `Button`, `Text`, etc.

### Previewing Composables

What is great about composables is that we can preview them easily, which was not the case for views. Yes, we could preview views but it wasn't easy to display just parts of them without creating multiple files. With Compose, we can go as deep or as shallow as we want to.

_Listing {% increment listingId20220810  %}_
```kotlin
@Preview(showBackground = true, backgroundColor = 0xFFFFFF)
@Composable
fun SomeComposablePreview() {
    SomeComposable()
}
```

## How to Set Up Your Project for Compose?

In this demonstration, I am using Android Studio Chipmunk 2021.2.1 Patch 1.

To create a Compose application, in Android Studio:

1. In the top menu bar, click **File -> New -> New Project...**.
2. In the newly opened window, click **Empty Compose Activity** and then **Next**.
   <div markdown="0">
   <img class="lazyload" data-src="{{ images | absolute_url | append: "/NewProject.webp" }}" alt="New project window of Android Studio">
   </div>
   _Figure {% increment figureId20220810 %}. New project window of Android Studio._
1. Give a name to your application and the package. In our tutorial, these are "Wavetable Synthesizer" and "com.thewolfsound.wavetablesynthesizer" respectively. Also choose the location for your project files.
   <div markdown="0">
   <img class="lazyload" data-src="{{ images | absolute_url | append: "/ProjectSetup.webp" }}" alt="Project setup window of Android Studio">
   </div>
   _Figure {% increment figureId20220810 %}. Setup of an empty Compose activity._
1. Click **Finish**.

Congratulations! You have just generated a Compose project ðŸ˜Ž

## Working with Compose

You should have obtained a file named *MainActivity.kt*. This file shows you how to build a simple composable and how to preview it.

In general, you create a composable by annotating a function with the `@Composable` annotation.

_Listing {% increment listingId20220810  %}_
```kotlin
@Composable
fun Greeting() {
    Text(text = "Hello, World!")
}
```

You can preview the composable by writing another function and annotating it with the `@Preview` annotation.

Previews must be composables as well so you also need to prefix them with the `@Composable` annotation.

_Listing {% increment listingId20220810  %}_
```kotlin
@Preview(showBackground = true)
@Composable
fun DefaultPreview() {
    WavetableSynthesizerTheme {
        Greeting()
    }
}
```
## Setting the Theme of Your UI

`WavetableSynthesizerTheme` is a theme of your app defined in `ui.theme` subpackage in the file *Theme.kt*. The theme contains colors, fonts, and shapes your app should use.

For now, we will change the colors to match WolfSound's visual identity. For this, we need to edit the file *Color.kt*.

_Listing {% increment listingId20220810  %}_
```kotlin
package com.thewolfsound.wavetablesynthesizer.ui.theme

import androidx.compose.ui.graphics.Color

val WolfSoundOrange = Color(0xFFEF7600)
val WolfSoundDarkOrange = Color(0xFF854200)
val WolfSoundGray = Color(0xFF7C7C7C)
```

We can now edit the *Theme.kt* file. There, we replace the previous definitions of palettes with our own ones.

_Listing {% increment listingId20220810  %}_
```kotlin
//...
private val DarkColorPalette = darkColors(
    primary = WolfSoundOrange,
    primaryVariant = WolfSoundDarkOrange,
    secondary = WolfSoundGray
)

private val LightColorPalette = lightColors(
    primary = WolfSoundOrange,
    primaryVariant = WolfSoundDarkOrange,
    secondary = WolfSoundGray
)
//...
```

The remaining default code in the file can stay as it was generated.

## Building the UI of Our Synthesizer App

Let me show you how the UI of our synthesizer will look like at the end.

<div markdown="0">
<img class="lazyload" data-src="{{ images | absolute_url | append: "/SynthesizerUI.webp" }}" alt="Graphical user interface of the synthesizer app">
</div>

_Figure {% increment figureId20220810 %}. Graphical user interface of the synthesizer app we are going to build._

To build it, we can follow a top-down approach or a bottom-up approach.

I prefer the former because I find it easier to divide the UI mentally into boxes.

### Entry Point of the App

Instead of using previews, we will be building our app on the emulator because it's fast and easy to set up for the landscape orientation.

The entry point of our application is the `onCreate()` method of `MainActivity` class. So let's replace the generated code with the following one.

_Listing {% increment listingId20220810  %}_
```kotlin
class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        requestedOrientation = ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE
        setContent {
            WavetableSynthesizerTheme {
                Surface(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
                    color = MaterialTheme.colors.background) {
                    WavetableSynthesizerApp(Modifier)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

@Composable
fun WavetableSynthesizerApp(
    modifier: Modifier
) {
}
```

Let's comment on this code a little bit.

1. `super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)` was generated by default so we leave it as it is.
2. `requestedOrientation` allows us to enforce a particular screen orientation of our activity. In this case, it is the landscape orientation.
3. `setContent` is a special method within which we can place our composables. As you can see, we put there a `Surface` (which is a composable shipped with Compose) wrapped in our theme class.
4. `Surface` contains our first own composable, namely, the now-empty `WavetableSynthesizerApp`.

After compiling and running this, you should obtain a blank screen. But working! ðŸ˜„

Here, you can see **the first rule of composables:**

> Curly braces (`{` and `}`) after a composable call define **what's inside** a composable.

In this way, we can nest composables. Remember, that we cannot nest anything else than composables.

After this success, let's divide our UI into more fine-grained parts.

### What Are Modifiers in Compose?

You may be wondering why we pass a `Modifier` instance into our composables. This allows us to modify them from outside without changing the code. I am using it here just to demonstrate it as a recommended best practice.

We'll soon use the modifiers to fill rows and columns relative to their sizes.

### Dividing the Screen Into Boxes

We will now divide our emulator's screen into boxes that correspond to the parts of the UI.

That's how our main composable looks now

_Listing {% increment listingId20220810  %}_
```kotlin
@Composable
fun WavetableSynthesizerApp(
    modifier: Modifier
) {
        Column(
            modifier = modifier.fillMaxSize(),
            horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally,
            verticalArrangement = Arrangement.Top,
        ) {
            // These two composables will be shortly defined
            WavetableSelectionPanel(modifier)
            ControlsPanel(modifier)
        }
}
```

In essence, we filled the whole screen with a single column with a specific horizontal alignment and vertical arrangement.

Inside the `Column`, which is Compose's container type, we put two more composables: `WavetableSelctionPanel` and `ControlsPanel`. As these are placed one after the other, they are treated by Compose as one level of the hierarchy. This is **the second and final rule of composables**.

In this case, we have a column where the first element starting from the top is `WavetableSelctionPanel` and the second is `ControlsPanel`. These two composables are centered horizontally.

We can now define these two composables.

_Listing {% increment listingId20220810  %}_
```kotlin
@Composable
private fun WavetableSelectionPanel(
    modifier: Modifier
) {
    Row(
        modifier = modifier
            .fillMaxWidth()
            .fillMaxHeight(0.5f)
            .border(BorderStroke(5.dp, Color.Black)),
        horizontalArrangement = Arrangement.SpaceEvenly,
        verticalAlignment = Alignment.CenterVertically
    ) {
        Column(
            modifier = modifier
                .fillMaxWidth()
                .fillMaxHeight()
                .border(BorderStroke(5.dp, Color.Black)),
            verticalArrangement = Arrangement.SpaceEvenly,
            horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally
        ) {
            Text("Wavetable selection panel")
        }
    }
}

@Composable
private fun ControlsPanel(
    modifier: Modifier
) {
    Row(
        modifier = modifier
            .fillMaxWidth()
            .fillMaxHeight()
            .border(BorderStroke(5.dp, Color.Black)),
        horizontalArrangement = Arrangement.Center,
        verticalAlignment = Alignment.CenterVertically
    ) {
        Column(
            modifier = modifier
                .fillMaxHeight()
                .fillMaxWidth(0.7f)
                .border(BorderStroke(5.dp, Color.Black)),
            horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally
        ) {
            Text("Pitch and play control")
        }
        Column(
            verticalArrangement = Arrangement.Center,
            horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally,
            modifier = modifier
                .fillMaxWidth()
                .fillMaxHeight()
                .border(BorderStroke(5.dp, Color.Black))
        ) {
            Text("Volume control")
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see, I put rows and columns with specified relative widths and heights to fill our screen.

I intentionally added a thick border to see show you how our columns are placed.

Here's the result.

<div markdown="0">
<img class="lazyload" data-src="{{ images | absolute_url | append: "/InitialBoxes.webp" }}" alt="Initial version of the UI with rows and columns">
</div>

_Figure {% increment figureId20220810 %}. App's UI divided into rows and columns with borders._

Now, let's fill these boxes!

### Wavetable Selection Panel

To create clickable buttons with wavetable names (which will alter the timbre of our synthesizer) we put inside the following two composables.

_Listing {% increment listingId20220810  %}_
```kotlin
// inside WavetableSelectionPanel composable
Text(stringResource(R.string.wavetable))
WavetableSelectionButtons(modifier)
//...

@Composable
private fun WavetableSelectionButtons(
    modifier: Modifier
) {
    Row(
        modifier = modifier.fillMaxWidth(),
        horizontalArrangement = Arrangement.SpaceEvenly
    ) {
        for (wavetable in arrayOf("Sine", "Triangle", "Square", "Saw")) {
            WavetableButton(
                modifier = modifier,
                onClick = {},
                label = wavetable)
        }
    }
}

@Composable
private fun WavetableButton(
    modifier: Modifier,
    onClick: () -> Unit,
    label: String,
) {
    Button(modifier = modifier, onClick = onClick) {
        Text(label)
    }
}
```

In order for the above code to work, you need to modify the strings resource file (*res/values/strings.xml*).

_Listing {% increment listingId20220810  %}_
```xml
<resources>
    <string name="app_name">Wavetable Synthesizer</string>
    <string name="wavetable">Wavetable</string>
</resources>
```

Inside our `WavetableSelectionPanel` we a put a title (`Text` composable) and another panel with buttons (`Button` composables).

As you can see in `WavetableSelectionButtons`, we can **iteratively place composables**. How cool is that?

The array I used there is just temporary; we will have a proper `Wavetable` class later on.

Additionally, we pass an empty `onClick` callback because we don't define any logic yet.

Our UI should now look like this:

<div markdown="0">
<img class="lazyload" data-src="{{ images | absolute_url | append: "/WavetableSelectionPanelComplete.webp" }}" alt="UI with wavetable selection buttons in the upper half">
</div>

_Figure {% increment figureId20220810 %}. App's UI with a complete wavetable selection panel._

### Pitch and Play Control

To control the fundamental frequency we will use a simple slider. To control the playback we will use a Play/Stop button.

For this we replace the "Pitch and Play Control" `Text` composable with two new ones: `PitchControl` and `PlayControl`.

_Listing {% increment listingId20220810  %}_
```kotlin
// Inside ControlsPanel, instead of Text("Pitch and play control")
PitchControl(modifier)
PlayControl(modifier)
//...

@Composable
private fun PitchControl(
    modifier: Modifier
) {
    val sliderPosition = rememberSaveable { mutableStateOf(300F) }

    PitchControlContent(
        modifier = modifier,
        pitchControlLabel = stringResource(R.string.frequency),
        value = sliderPosition.value,
        onValueChange = {
            sliderPosition.value = it
        },
        valueRange = 20F..3000F,
        frequencyValueLabel = stringResource(R.string.frequency_value,
                                             sliderPosition.value)
    )
}

@Composable
private fun PitchControlContent(
    modifier: Modifier,
    pitchControlLabel: String,
    value: Float,
    onValueChange: (Float) -> Unit,
    valueRange: ClosedFloatingPointRange<Float>,
    frequencyValueLabel: String
) {
    Text(pitchControlLabel, modifier = modifier)
    Slider(modifier = modifier,
           value = value,
           onValueChange = onValueChange,
           valueRange = valueRange)
    Row(
        modifier = modifier,
        horizontalArrangement = Arrangement.Center
    ) {
        Text(modifier = modifier, text = frequencyValueLabel)
    }
}

@Composable
private fun PlayControl(modifier: Modifier) {
    Button(modifier = modifier,
        onClick = {}) {
        Text(stringResource(R.string.play))
    }
}
```

The above code requires adding the following strings to *res/values/strings.xml*:

_Listing {% increment listingId20220810  %}_
```xml
<string name="play">Play</string>
<string name="frequency">Frequency</string>
<string name="frequency_value">%.1f Hz</string>
```

What has happened here?

The `PlayControl` is just a simple button with a text and no action on click.

However, the slider is a different thing. You may notice right away that we have separate `PitchControl` and `PitchControlContent`. Why is that?

In essence, `PitchControlContent` is a **stateless composable**. It is *just* the UI, nothing more. It does not handle any logic, it does not update any variables. It defines the elements inside passively, we could say.

On the other hand, `PitchControl` holds all the UI state related to `PitchControlContent`.

It defines the content of all the labels that `PitchControlContent` should display. It passes the `OnValueChange` listener. It defines the slider's range. It formats the frequency label.

But most importantly, it **remembers the mutable state of the slider position**.

This is an example of the so-called **state hoisting**.

### What Is State Hoisting in Compose?

**State hoisting** means that a composable is given its state "from the outside". That includes the content of its labels, the values of its sliders, the callbacks it should invoke on clicking or dragging, etc.

The reason of hoisting the state outside of a composable is that it makes the composable easier to test. The composables without a state are called **stateless composables**.

In our example, `PitchControlContent` is a stateless composable and `PitchControl` is hoisting its state.

In the [next part of the tutorial]({% post_url collections.posts, 'synthesis/android-wavetable-synthesizer/2022-09-11-view-model' %}), we will hoist the state using `ViewModel`s but for now let's keep it simple.

The important part of the state hoisting is this line:

_Listing {% increment listingId20220810  %}_
```kotlin
val sliderPosition = rememberSaveable { mutableStateOf(300F) }
```

Here we define an instance of a class `MutableState<Float>`.

The `mutableStateOf` part creates the `MutableState` instance with an initial value, which in our case is 300 (as a floating-point number).

The `rememberSaveable` part remembers the current value even if our app goes into the background or the UI is reconfigured. The state will be "forgotten" only if we close the app.

If we remove the `mutableStateOf` part, we won't be able to change the value of the slider; the Compose framework will always set its value to 300 on UI recomposition.

If we remove the `rememberSaveable` part, we won't be able to change the value of the slider either; this time the Compose framework  won't know that this is a state that it should observe and cause a UI recomposition if it changes (we change it in `onValueChange` listener when the slider position changes). So `sliderPosition`'s value may change underneath (I actually haven't tested that) but the change won't be displayed.

We will revisit these concepts in the [next part]({% post_url collections.posts, 'synthesis/android-wavetable-synthesizer/2022-09-11-view-model' %}), when we deal with `ViewModel`s.

### Volume Control

The last part of the UI is the volume control.

We replace `Text("Volume control")` with `VolumeControl(modifier)` in `ControlsPanel` and add the following code to *MainActivity.kt*.

_Listing {% increment listingId20220810  %}_
```kotlin
@Composable
private fun VolumeControl(modifier: Modifier) {
    val volume = rememberSaveable { mutableStateOf(0F) }

    VolumeControlContent(
        modifier = modifier,
        volume = volume.value,
        volumeRange = -60F..0F,
        onValueChange = { volume.value = it })
}

@Composable
private fun VolumeControlContent(
    modifier: Modifier,
    volume: Float,
    volumeRange: ClosedFloatingPointRange<Float>,
    onValueChange: (Float) -> Unit
) {
    // The volume slider should take around 1/4 of the screen height
    val screenHeight = LocalConfiguration.current.screenHeightDp
    val sliderHeight = screenHeight / 4

    Icon(imageVector = Icons.Filled.VolumeUp, contentDescription = null)
    Column(
        modifier = modifier
            .fillMaxWidth()
            .fillMaxHeight(0.8f)
            .offset(y = 40.dp),
        horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally,
        verticalArrangement = Arrangement.SpaceBetween
    )
    {
        Slider(
            value = volume,
            onValueChange = onValueChange,
            modifier = modifier
                .width(sliderHeight.dp)
                .rotate(270f),
            valueRange = volumeRange
        )
    }
    Icon(imageVector = Icons.Filled.VolumeMute, contentDescription = null)
}
```

The usage of icons requires us to add the following dependency to the *build.gradle* file of our `app` module:

_Listing {% increment listingId20220810  %}_
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation "androidx.compose.material:material-icons-extended:$compose_version"
}
```

where `compose_version` variable is `1.1.1` in my case.

Here again `VolumeControlContent` is a stateless composable and `VolumeControl` hoists its state (the position of the slider).

Because Compose does not support vertical sliders, I had to come up with a little bit hacky code to have one. But it works perfectly ðŸ˜‰

In essence I make a slider which takes 1/4 of the screen's height (remember that we are in the landscape orientation) and is rotated by 270 degrees.

The range of the volume slider is from -60 to 0 because these are the values in decibels that we will use.

### Final Touches: Removing Borders

That's the current look of our UI:

<div markdown="0">
<img class="lazyload" data-src="{{ images | absolute_url | append: "/FinalDesignWithBoxes.webp" }}" alt="Final look of the app UI with column borders">
</div>

_Figure {% increment figureId20220810 %}. The final look of the app UI but still with borders._

We can remove all `border` modifiers to obtain the final look:

<div markdown="0">
<img class="lazyload" data-src="{{ images | absolute_url | append: "/FinalDesign.webp" }}" alt="Final look of the app UI">
</div>

_Figure {% increment figureId20220810 %}. The final look of the app UI._

The full source code of the *MainActivity.kt* file and the resources files can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/JanWilczek/android-wavetable-synthesizer).

## Part 2 Summary

In the second part of the tutorial, we discussed

* how to implement the user interface with buttons, sliders, labels, and icons using Jetpack Compose,
* we defined the theme of our app,
* explained what are composables,
* how to compose them,
* what are stateless composables,
* what is state hoisting,
* and when a recomposition happens.

## List of Imports

Here is the list of the import statements in *MainActivity.kt* as of this tutorial:

_Listing {% increment listingId20220810  %}_
```kotlin
import android.content.pm.ActivityInfo
import android.os.Bundle
import androidx.activity.ComponentActivity
import androidx.activity.compose.setContent
import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.*
import androidx.compose.material.*
import androidx.compose.material.icons.Icons
import androidx.compose.material.icons.filled.VolumeMute
import androidx.compose.material.icons.filled.VolumeUp
import androidx.compose.runtime.*
import androidx.compose.runtime.saveable.rememberSaveable
import androidx.compose.ui.Alignment
import androidx.compose.ui.Modifier
import androidx.compose.ui.draw.rotate
import androidx.compose.ui.platform.LocalConfiguration
import androidx.compose.ui.res.stringResource
import androidx.compose.ui.tooling.preview.Devices
import androidx.compose.ui.tooling.preview.Preview
import androidx.compose.ui.unit.dp
import com.thewolfsound.wavetablesynthesizer.ui.theme.WavetableSynthesizerTheme
```

I sometimes find it confusing what to import so I included all the imports from *MainActivity.kt* here for your convenience ðŸ˜‰

## Further Materials

If you want to learn the basics of Compose, I recommend doing [this codelab from Google](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/jetpack-compose-layouts). I found it very approachable for beginners.

If you want to understand the concept of state hoisting, I recommend watching [this video by Alejandra Stamato and Manuel Vivo](https://youtu.be/PMMY23F0CFg). It is a bit lengthy and maybe not as cleanly explained but still, in the end, you will understand the concept fully.
