Let's write a wavetable synthesizer in Python!

This article is a follow-up to the [article on wavetable synthesis theory]({% post_url synthesis/2021-08-13-wavetable-synthesis-theory %}). Here we will implement the algorithms explained there. Please refer back to that article if you find some background information missing.

Below is the listing containing a wavetable synthesizer implemented in Python.

Sound is generated by calling the `synthesize()` method of a `Voice` class object. `Voice` objects are monophonic (can play just 1 pitch at a time) and contain arbitrarily many oscillators whose outputs are summed together. We can think of it as creating "layers" of timbre. 1 oscillator = 1 periodic waveform.

`Voice`'s oscillators can be arbitrary oscillators but in this implementation we use wavetable oscillators as represented by the `WavetableOscillator` class.

`WavetableOscillator` objects have a set frequency and generate sound by looping over a wave table. `wavetable_index` gets incremented with each sample produced by the `getSample()` method. The increment depends on the frequency, sampling rate and wave table length.

Should you have any questions, please, write a comment below!
