How to convolve and do nothing at the same time?

1. **Identity element of the convolution**

* no neutral element among functions
* Dirac delta (continuous and discrete)
* convolution with a delta, the sifting property
* the concept of delay and its application in DSP
* notation considerations ([n-n0], etc.)
* discrete-time signal or sampling as a convolutional sum, a weighted sum of impulses
