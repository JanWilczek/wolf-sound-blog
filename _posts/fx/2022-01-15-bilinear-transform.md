To design and implement a parametric filter, [4 steps are needed]({% post_url fx/2021-11-26-parametric-eq-design %}):

1.	[Decide on the filter type you want to implement.]({% post_url fx/2021-11-26-parametric-eq-design %}#step-1-decide-on-the-filter-type)
2.	[Design an analog prototype.]({% post_url fx/2021-12-03-analog-prototype %})
3.	**Digitize the analog prototype using the bilinear transform.**
4.	Implement the digital filter in code.


In this article, we'll explain the second step of that process: how to go from an analog prototype to a digital form of the parametric filter. This is shown on the diagram below.

## System Digitization Methods

There are many methods of digitalization (discretization) of analog (continuous) systems. The most popular ones are [OppenheimSchafer10]:

* *impulse-invariant transformation (IIT)*: sampling the impulse response of the continuous system,
* *bilinear transformation (BT)*: mapping the transfer function of the continuous system from the $s$-plane to the $z$-plane.

Because the impulse-invariant transformation may introduce aliasing, in the music domain, we usually use the bilinear transform. So how is it defined?

## The Bilinear Transform

> The bilinear transform is a change of variables, mapping the $j \omega$ frequency axis of the $s$-plane to the unit circle of the $z$-plane.

Given an analog transfer function $H_\text{a}(s)$ in the $s$-domain, we obtain the discrete transfer function $H_\text{d}(z)$ in the $z$-domain by substituting

$$s = \frac{2}{T} \frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 + z^{-1}}, \quad ({% increment equationId20220115 %})$$

where $T = 1 / f_s$ is the sampling interval of the discrete system with $f_s$ being the sampling rate. Therefore,

$$H_\text{d}(z) = H_\text{a}\left(\frac{2}{T} \frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 + z^{-1}}\right). \quad ({% increment equationId20220115 %})$$

We can go back from the discrete transfer function to the analog transfer function by substituting

$$z = \frac{1-sT/2}{1+sT/2}, \quad ({% increment equationId20220115 %})$$

what can be directly derived from Equation 1.

The bilinear transform formulas are summarized in Figure 2 (with $c=2/T$).

## Derivation of the Bilinear Transform

How is the bilinear transform derived? How to come up with the mapping in Equation 1?

Below, I give you a simple, intuitive explanation. If you are not interested in it, you can [skip to the properties of the bilinear transform](#properties-of-the-bilinear-transform).

The $s \rightarrow z$ mapping of the bilinear transform may be explained as a derivation of a digital representation of an integrator.

An integrator is a system at whose output the integral of the input signal may be observed

$$y(t) = \int \limits_0^t x(\tau) d\tau, \quad ({% increment equationId20220115 %})$$

where $x(t)$ is the input signal over continuous time $t$ and $y(t)$ is the output signal of the integrator.

The Laplace transform of Equation 4 yields

$$Y(s) = \frac{1}{s}X(s), \quad ({% increment equationId20220115 %})$$

where $s \in \mathbb{C}$. Therefore, the integrator can be shown on the diagram as in Figure 3.

![]({{ page.images | absolute_url | append: "/IntegratorDiagram.webp"}}){: alt="A diagram of the analog integrator system." width="50%" }
_Figure {% increment figureId20220115 %}. A diagram of the analog integrator system._

We want to obtain a discrete system described by a discrete transfer function $G(z)$ that behaves like $\frac{1}{s}$. To this end, we observe the output of the continuous system at discrete time points $t = kT$, where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $T$ is the sampling interval (inverse of the sampling rate).

$$y(kT) = \int \limits_{0}^{kT} x(\tau) d\tau = \int \limits_{0}^{(k-1)T} x(\tau) d \tau + \int \limits_{(k-1)T}^{kT} x(\tau) d \tau 
\\= y((k-1)T) + \int \limits_{(k-1)T}^{kT} x(\tau) d \tau. \quad ({% increment equationId20220115 %})$$

We can now approximate the last integral in Equation 6 via the [trapezoidal rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule)

$$\int \limits_{(k-1)T}^{kT} x(\tau) d \tau \approx (x((k-1)T) + x(kT))T / 2. \quad ({% increment equationId20220115 %})$$

Inserting Equation 7 into Equation 6 yields

$$y(kT) = y((k-1)T) + (x((k-1)T) + x(kT))T / 2. \quad ({% increment equationId20220115 %})$$

We now transform Equation 8 with the $z$-transformation

$$Y(z) = z^{-1} Y(z) + (z^{-1} X(z) + X(z))T / 2. \quad ({% increment equationId20220115 %})$$

After rearranging Equation 9 we obtain the transfer function formulation

$$Y(z) = \frac{T}{2}\frac{1 + z^{-1}}{1 - z^{-1}} X(z) = G(z) X(z). \quad ({% increment equationId20220115 %})$$

Since $G(z)$ was meant to approximate $\frac{1}{s}$, we can write

$$\frac{1}{s} = G(z) = \frac{T}{2}\frac{1 + z^{-1}}{1 - z^{-1}}. \quad ({% increment equationId20220115 %})$$

which after inversion gives Equation 1, i.e., the bilinear transform. $\Box$

The bilinear transform can also be derived by representing a signal as a series of impulses, calculating its Laplace transform and $z$-transform, equating the two, and approximating the resulting $s$-to-$z$ mapping with a series expansion. But the integrator derivation seems more intuitive to me, especially the origin of the $\frac{2}{T}$ constant. What do you think? Let me know in the comments below the article. ðŸ˜‰

## Properties of the Bilinear Transform

> In the following, we assume that $\omega_\text{a} = 2 \pi f_\text{a}$ (with $f_\text{a}$ in Hz) denotes the analog frequency in radians per second (value on the $j\omega$ axis of the $s$-plane) and $\omega_\text{d} = 2 \pi f_\text{d}$ (with $f_\text{d}$ in Hz) denotes the digital frequency in radians per second (corresponding to the angle of a point on the unit circle of the $z$-plane).

The bilinear transform has a number of useful properties [ParksBurrus87].

First of all, it is called *bilinear* because **the numerator and the denominator are linear in $z$.**

Second of all, **the bilinear transform maps the left half-plane of the $s$-plane into the interior of of the unit circle in the $z$-plane**. This is shown on Figure 4.

![]({{ page.images | absolute_url | append: "/BilinearTransformVisualization.webp"}}){: alt="A visualization of the bilinear transform." width="100%" }
_Figure {% increment figureId20220115 %}. Bilinear transform maps the left half-plane of the $s$-plane into the unit circle of the $z$-plane. The infinitely long analog frequency axis $j\omega$ becomes the finite-length circle. Axis bending in the middle is shown only for the visualization purposes: it is not what is meant by the mathematics._

As a consequence, the poles from the left half-plane of the $s$-plane are mapped to the poles within the unit circle of the $z$-plane. That means that **stable analog filters are transformed into stable digital filters**, what is a very desirable property in the context of musically useful parametric filters.

In the same way, the $j\omega_\text{a}$ analog frequency axis from the $s$-plane is mapped to the $z = e^{j\omega_\text{d}T}$ unit circle of the $z$-plane. That means that the analog system's frequency response over an infinite domain gets squashed around a finite-length circle. 

The above mappings mean that **the bilinear transform is a nonlinear mapping of the phase and the frequency**. The former results in the nonlinear phase of the resulting IIR filters [OppenheimSchafer10]. The latter manifests itself in the form of [frequency warping](#frequency-warping) as discussed later in the article.

Other properties of the bilinear transform are:

* the obtained digital filter has the same order as the analog prototype,
* optimality is preserved (e.g., maximally flat analog prototypes become maximally flat discrete filters),
* a cascade of systems transformed with the bilinear transform is equivalent to the bilinear transform of a cascade of these systems.

## Frequency Warping

The bilinear transform maps the full, infinite analog frequency axis to a finite-length discrete frequency axis (the unit circle). That results in *frequency warping*: "equal increments along the unit circle in the $z$ plane correspond to larger and larger bandwidths along the $j\omega_\text{a}$ axis in the $s$-plane" [Smith07].

The mathematical relation between the analog frequencies $\omega_\text{a}$ and digital frequencies $\omega_\text{d}$ can be found by evaluating the transform along the analog frequency axis and the digital frequency axis. In other words, we need to insert $s = j \omega_\text{a}$ and $z = e^{j\omega_\text{d} T}$ into Equation 1

$$j \omega_\text{a} = \frac{2}{T}\frac{1 - e^{-j\omega_\text{d}T}}{1 + e^{-j\omega_\text{d}T}}
= \frac{2}{T}\frac{e^{-j\omega_\text{d}T/2}(e^{j\omega_\text{d}T/2} - e^{-j\omega_\text{d}T/2})}{e^{-j\omega_\text{d}T/2}(e^{2j\omega_\text{d}T/2} + e^{-j\omega_\text{d}T/2})}
\\= \frac{2}{T} \frac{j \sin(\omega_\text{d} T / 2)}{\cos(\omega_\text{d}T / 2)} = j \frac{2}{T} \tan(\omega_\text{d}T/2). \quad ({% increment equationId20220115 %})$$

Therefore,

$$\omega_\text{a} = \frac{2}{T} \tan(\omega_\text{d}T/2). \quad ({% increment equationId20220115 %})$$

From Equation 13, we can obtain the inverse relation

$$\omega_\text{d} = \frac{2}{T} \text{arctan}(\omega_\text{a} T / 2). \quad ({% increment equationId20220115 %})$$

The visualization of Equation 14 on Figure 5 shows what is frequency warping.

## Prewarping

In order to account for frequency warping of the bilinear transform in filter design, we need to perform the so-called *prewarping*.
The prototype filter frequency scale must be prewarped so that after the bilinear transform the *critical frequencies* are in the correct places.

In other words, we want to have

$$H_\text{a}(j \omega_\text{a0}) = H_\text{d}(\omega_\text{d0}) = H^*, \quad ({% increment equationId20220115 %})$$

where we choose $\omega_\text{a0}$ and $\omega_\text{d0}$ (desired critical ferquencies of the prototype and digital filters respectively).

This goal can be easily achieved by simply scaling the analog frequency axis with a proper scalar before the bilinear transform.

In the context of parametric filters, our critical frequency will typically be the cutoff frequency of a filter, because that's the frequency for which we want to have a specific transfer function value. But let's derive the general scaling.

### Prewarping Factor Derivation

Given critical frequencies $\omega_\text{a0}$ and $\omega_\text{d0}$, we want to find a scaling factor $K \in \mathbb{R}$ such that 

$$H_\text{a}(j \omega_\text{a0}) = H_\text{d}(\omega_\text{d0}) = H^*, \quad ({% increment equationId20220115 %})$$

and

$$H_\text{d}(z) = H_\text{a}(K s) \forall z \in \mathbb{C}, \quad ({% increment equationId20220115 %})$$

where $s$ is given by Equation 1 (the bilinear transform).

From Equation 13, we know that without scaling by $K$

$$\omega_\text{a0} = \frac{2}{T} \tan(\omega_\text{d0}T/2). \quad ({% increment equationId20220115 %})$$

Here $\omega_\text{a0}$ and $\omega_\text{d0}$ are coupled; we cannot change them independently. To change this, we introduce the scaling $K$ (Equation 17)

$$\omega_\text{a0} = K \frac{2}{T} \tan(\omega_\text{d0}T/2). \quad ({% increment equationId20220115 %})$$

Solving for $K$

$$K = \frac{\omega_\text{a0}}{\tan(\omega_\text{d0}T/2)} \frac{T}{2} \quad ({% increment equationId20220115 %})$$

allows us to independently change $\omega_\text{a0}$ and $\omega_\text{d0}$. $\Box$

So the bilinear transform combined with prewarping gives the following formula for $s$ substitution

$$s = \frac{\omega_\text{a0}}{\tan(\omega_\text{d0}T/2)} \frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 + z^{-1}}. \quad ({% increment equationId20220115 %})$$

### Cutoff Frequency from Prewarping

As you might recall from [the analog prototype design tutorial]({% post_url fx/2021-12-03-analog-prototype %}), we design our analog filters to have the cutoff frequency equal to 1. Since thanks to prewarping, we can independently change $\omega_\text{a0}$ and $\omega_\text{d0}$, we can simply set $\omega_\text{a0} = 1$ and $\omega_\text{d0} = \omega_\text{dc}$ (cutoff frequency of the digital filter). Thus, Equation 21 (bilinear transform + prewarping) becomes

$$s = \frac{1}{\tan(\omega_\text{d0} T/2)} \frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 + z^{-1}}. \quad ({% increment equationId20220115 %})$$

So prewarping actally lets us set the cutoff frequency of the filter we design ðŸ™‚

## Example: Digitization of the Butterworth Low-Pass

Finally, let's put to practice all that we've learned.

Let us digitize the analog prototype Butterworth low-pass of order 2 that we designed in [the previous article]({% post_url fx/2021-12-03-analog-prototype %}).

It's transfer function in the $s$-domain was

$$H_a(s) = \frac{1}{s^2 + s \sqrt{2} + 1}. \quad ({% increment equationId20220115 %})$$

The cutoff frequency was set to 1.

To obtain a digital filter with the digital cutoff frequency equal to $\omega_\text{c}$ from Equation 23, we perform the bilinear transform with prewarping by inserting Equation 22 into Equation 23.

After very simple but tiresome derivations, we obtain

$$H_2(z) = \frac{W^2 + 2W^2 z^{-1} + W^2z^{-2}}{1 + W \sqrt{2} + W^2 + 2(W^2 - 1)z^{-1} + (W^2 - W\sqrt{2} + 1)z^{-2}}, \quad ({% increment equationId20220115 %})$$

where $W = \tan(\omega_\text{c} T / 2)$ and $\omega_\text{c}$ is the desired cutoff frequency of the digital filter in radians per second. The above result matches the one in [ZÃ¶lzer08].

We thus obtained a stable IIR filter of order 2 with controllable cutoff frequency. Yay!

### Efficiency

The filter in Equation 24 is efficient during processing but setting its cutoff frequency requires calculating the value of 5 coefficients (after normalization). That parameter-to-coefficient mapping is not efficient at all. Therefore, we need to turn to allpass-based filters... But that will be a topic of a different article. ðŸ˜‰

## Summary

In summary, in this article we learned that the bilinear transform is a great method that allows us to digitize analog prototype filters. 

We learned how to derive the bilinear transform by approximating a continuous-time integrator. We learned the properties of the bilinear transform such as stability and optimality preservation. We also counteracted the frequency warping with prewarping. 

We learned that with prewarping we can set the cutoff frequency of analog prototypes to 1 because prewarping alters it anyway. 

Finally, we discretized the second-order analog Butterworth low-pass with the bilinear transform and prewarping and obtained an IIR filter.
