## Introduction

In this episode, I was honored to interview Andrew Fyfe; a musician, a software engineer, and a researcher in the field of deep learning applied to audio.

In particular, Andrew is working on an exciting new technology, Neutone. Neutone allows quick deployment of trained neural networks to audio plugins and running them in the digital audio workstation for verification, testing, up to full-blown product releases for users.

At the same time, Andrew is wrapping up his PhD while working full time from Japan. He was kind enough to share his story and his journey to becoming an audio researcher.

Don‚Äôt forget to submit your plugins for the [**Neural Audio Plugin Competition**](https://www.theaudioprogrammer.com/neural-audio) until March the 17th of 2023!
