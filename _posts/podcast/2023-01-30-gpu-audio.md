## Introduction

In this episode, I was lucky to interview two members of GPU Audio: Jonathan Rowden and Alexander ‚ÄúSasha‚Äù Talashov.

GPU Audio is a software company that promises to deliver real-time audio processing capabilities to GPUs in the form of an easily usable Software Development Kit (SDK). It‚Äôs their goal to allow audio programmers to utilize the power of all GPU cores for faster and more performant audio processing.

If you are interested in why it is not easy to process audio on the GPU and how it can be done, then this episode is for you!

Don‚Äôt forget to submit your impulse response for their **[IR Competition](https://www.gpu.audio/ircompetition)** until February 23, 2023!

*Note:*¬†If you like the podcast so far, please,¬†[go to Apple Podcasts and leave me a review there](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/wolftalk-podcast-about-audio-programming-people-careers/id1595913701). It will benefit both sides: more reviews mean a broader reach on Apple Podcasts and feedback can help me to improve the show and provide better quality content to you. Thank you for doing this üôè

## Episode Contents

In this podcast episode, you will learn:

* how was GPU Audio conceived,
* why typically GPUs are not used in audio plugins,
* why previous approaches to GPU audio processing haven‚Äôt been widely successful,
* how GPU Audio‚Äôs solution handles the main problems of GPU processing,
* how one can learn about GPU processing in general,
* how you can help test their software and possibly win cool prizes in their IR competition.
