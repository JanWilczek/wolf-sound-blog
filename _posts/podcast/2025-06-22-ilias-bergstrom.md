## Introduction
Ilias Bergstrom is a Software Engineer, Researcher, Interaction Designer, and Musician with a deep love for audio software. He is passionate about software for all kinds of live performance used together with music, including live graphics, controlled lighting, and VR experiences.

He has been involved in music from an early age, taking up drums and synthesizers as a teenager. His career spans over 20 years of developing media technology software and working as a researcher in the field. He has given four talks at the Audio Developer Conference.

In this interview, we explore not only Ilias’s personal journey but also many fascinating topics, including "time-based media software", which is a term he uses to describe this category of applications. He talks about how he connects the dots between different types of media software through his personal project Two, best described as a Media Control Workstation. It enables the interactive combination of digital media control signals (such as OSC and MIDI) from several simultaneous sources.

We also dive into the architecture of audio software, discussing how software architecture is crucial and also differs depending on the project. Ilias shares his favorite books on these topics, along with a ton of valuable tips and resources. You don’t want to miss this one!

## Episode Contents
From this episode, you will learn:
- How Ilias's interest in media creation software led to a career in audio, across both research and industry.
-	How he combines music and audio with interaction design, Human Computer Interaction, and even topics such as neuroscience and psychology, and how audio development can be seen as a form of creative coding.
-	How many media creation software tools share the same core characteristics and core architecture.
-	Insights into his personal software project, TWO.
-	The answer to the question: What does a PhD give you? And more broadly, what a university education can offer.
-	The importance of software architecture, planning, and documentation.
-	How the architecture process differs depending on the type of software you are building (whether it's sketching, production code, making art, saving lives, or building bridges)
-	A lot of highly useful book recommendations.
-	Practical advice on how to get started with audio development and audio software architecture.
