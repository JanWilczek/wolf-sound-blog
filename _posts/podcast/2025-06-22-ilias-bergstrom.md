## Introduction

Ilias Bergstrom is a software engineer, researcher, and musician from Sweden. For most of his professional career, spanning over 20 years, he has been working on, as he describes it, "time-based media software."

In the audio programming world, this means digital audio workstations, video editors, and live audio-visual performance software.

He generously shared his experience in Audio Developer Conference talks, two of which discuss the much underrepresented topic of the software architecture of digital audio workstations.

Software architecture and software design are fascinating topics to me, so I naturally devoured both of these talks ðŸ˜‰

In this interview, we explore not only Iliasâ€™s journey but also go into the details of what makes audio software design hard. He discusses how he connects the dots between different types of media software through his long-running personal project, TWO, which is best described as a Media Control Workstation. It enables the simultaneous interactive combination of digital media control signals (such as OSC and MIDI) from multiple sources.

Finally, we don't shy away from discussing our favorite books on audio software development! Given that Ilias shares a ton of valuable tips and resources, you donâ€™t want to miss this one!

## Episode Contents

From this episode, you will learn:

- How Ilias's interest in media creation software led to a career in audio, across both research and industry.
- How he combines music and audio with interaction design, Human Computer Interaction, and even topics such as neuroscience and psychology, and how audio development can be seen as a form of creative coding.
- How different media creation software tools (like DAWs) share the same core characteristics and core architecture.
- Insights into his personal software project, TWO.
- What does a PhD give you? What can a university education offer?
- The importance of software architecture, testing, and documentation.
- A lot of audio development book recommendations.
- Practical advice on how to get started with audio development and audio software architecture.
