## Introduction

One of [my top 10 Audio Developer Conference 2023 talks]({% post_url collections.posts, 'programming-in-general/2024-01-11-top-10-audio-developer-conference-2023-talks.md' %}) was [Gustav Andersson‚Äôs talk on optimizing C++ audio code](https://youtu.be/HdyiQLQCvfs?si=0Yi26KVDWurYweUf).

This made it all the more exciting to have Gustav on the show!

**Gustav Andersson** is a Swedish senior C++ audio developer at Elk Audio. He has worked on their Sensus guitar featuring a rich set of controls, Elk Audio OS for embedded platforms, Sushi digital audio workstation, and Elk Live software for live music collaboration over the internet.

Having studied Electrical Engineering and Digital Signal Processing, Gustav had been looking for a very long time to get into the audio industry. As for many developers, getting his first audio-related job was like a dream come true.

In his free time, Gustav plays and composes his own music.

In the interview, we discuss Gustav‚Äôs story, his journey to learn audio programming in C++, and his software projects, including his own plugin. We don‚Äôt shy away from software engineering details and architectural challenges of complex software like DAWs.

We mention a ton of resources and tips for learning real-time & scalable audio C++, so stay tuned for these!
