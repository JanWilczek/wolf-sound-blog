## Introduction

In this podcast episode, I was lucky to interview Jay Pocknell; a production and mixing engineer from the UK.

Not only is he a skilled sound engineer and a lovely person to talk to but also a proactive member of the audio community. He founded the Sound Without Sight organization and currently works at the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) advocating for music software, music hardware, and music instruments accessible to everyone: including musicians and sound engineers with disabilities.

Basing on his lived experience with sight loss, he gives invaluable advice on how **any audio programmer can make their software accessible**. This is a gold mine of first-hand information!

In the podcast episode, we discuss his path to becoming a sound engineer, which obstacles he needed to overcome, and how we as the audio community can remove some of these obstacles permanently.

## Tips for making your audio software accessible

1. Try out your software with a screen reader.
2. Check how keyboard-only navigation works.
3. Pay attention to logical and clear user interface layout.
4. Try turning off screen and using your software.
5. Pay attention to scalable, resizable user interface.
6. Pay attention to a good color contrast.
7. Pay attention to special accessibility labels of your controls (knobs, buttons, etc.).
8. Don‚Äôt neglect aesthetics.

Thank you for listening!
