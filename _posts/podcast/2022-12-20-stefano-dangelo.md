In this episode, I was incredibly excited to interview Stefano D‚ÄôAngelo: a freelancer in the field of audio programming.

Stefano comes from Italy and is well known in the field. He‚Äôs completed his PhD thesis at the Acoustics Lab of the Aalto University, then worked for Arturia for some time, and then decided to start his own freelance gig, which eventually led to him grounding the Orastron company. During this time, he‚Äôs been incredibly active in the programming field as well as in the research field.

Many WolfTalk listeners ask ‚Äúhow to become an audio programming freelancer?‚Äù

Well, in this podcast episode, you will learn a way of how this could be done üòâ
