## Introduction

In this podcast episode, I was lucky to interview Ruurd Adema: a freelance audio developer from the Netherlands working primarily in JUCE and C++ (but not only).

I met Ruurd at the Audio Developer Conference 2023 and I believe his story is incredibly inspiring; he went from being a live sound engineer doing front-of-house (FOH) mixing at the biggest events in the Netherlands to contracting as a freelance audio developer.

In the interview, he shares his story and a ton of useful resources and tips to help others follow his footsteps.

If you‚Äôre looking for inspiration and a clear learning path to become an audio developer this is an episode for you!
