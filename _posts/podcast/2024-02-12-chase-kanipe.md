## Introduction

In this podcast episode, I was lucky to interview Chase Kanipe: a cybersecurity professional, a musician, and an audio programmer (formerly C++ with JUCE, currently Rust). Chase is most widely known through his incredible Audio Developer Conference talks:

* [Tips From a Hacker on License Checking at ADC22](https://youtu.be/EPgSaH9q8UM?si=FcaHn4BziF2eL-KI)
* Writing Elegant DSP Code with Rust at ADC23 (to be released soon)

Both were really insightful and of incredibly high quality. One could not overlook Chase‚Äôs personal culture and the depth with which he explained the concepts. Not to mention that both of his talks made it into my ‚ÄúTop 10 ADC Talks‚Äù videos for both [ADC22](https://youtu.be/Aeq5Egj6TW0?si=puVQHp__1cCkcp5-) and [ADC23](https://youtu.be/4ohmt4yKtYA?si=Uh7wthPmz2zn3pNv)!

Chase is currently pursuing a master‚Äôs degree in Machine Learning at the University of Maryland. At the same time, he‚Äôs working on his breakthrough audio project in a self-grounded company Procedural Audio.

In the podcast, we discuss his path of being a classically trained musician, a passionate cybersecurity specialist, and then transitioning into audio programming with Rust and into AI. He‚Äôs an incredibly inspiring individual and I have learned a lot from interviewing him!

## Chase‚Äôs Tips

1. For learning a new concept/programming language: learn some first and then work on some inspiring software project.
2. For learning Rust: read and understand compiler messages.
