## Tips from Geraint on Learning DSP

1. A top-down approach can make learning DSP more accessible. Start hands-on and develop an understanding of the
   underlying principles, reaching the equations as needed.
2. Setting small, achievable goals and rewarding yourself at each stage can help you stay motivated.
3. Teaching reinforces your understanding and helps identify knowledge gaps.
4. Explore Web UIs for DSP tools. Accessible, browser-based interfaces powered by web technologies are becoming
   increasingly popular.
5. Use automated tests to validate basic DSP blocks, which gives you confidence in your implementations.
6. Finding a supportive community to help you when you get stuck is invaluable.
7. Don‚Äôt undervalue your skills as a freelancer. Whether you‚Äôre starting out or experienced, your time, skills, and
   knowledge have value.
