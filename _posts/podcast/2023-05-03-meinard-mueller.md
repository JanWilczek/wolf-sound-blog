## Introduction

In this podcast episode, we are extremely lucky to be able listen to and learn from Professor Meinard M√ºller from the International Audio Laboratories Erlangen (which is a joint institution of the University of Erlangen-N√ºrnberg and Fraunhofer IIS).

I‚Äôve met professor M√ºller in 2019 when I was studying Advanced Signal Processing and Communications Engineering at the University of Erlangen-N√ºrnberg. Not only did I immensely enjoy his lecture on ‚ÄúMusic Processing - Analysis‚Äù but also I have got to know him as an incredibly friendly and wise mentor, who goes above and beyond to help students understand a topic, develop the right skills, and advance personally.

His style of teaching has had a huge impact on how I structure my articles and videos. His book, ‚ÄúFundamentals of Music Processing‚Äù, is a great example of a textbook for students. His explanations are always clear, unambiguous, and concise. The world would be better off if more textbooks were written in a similar style üòâ

During the podcast episode, he does not only share his very personal story but also gives a gold mine of wisdom when it comes to finding one‚Äôs place in the research world. If you are a Bachelor, Master, or  a PhD student or an industry professional, who is considering going back to academia, this is the podcast episode for you.

Thank you, Meinard, for this talk from the bottom of my heart!

*Note:*¬†If you like the podcast so far, please,¬†[go to Apple Podcasts and leave me a review there](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/wolftalk-podcast-about-audio-programming-people-careers/id1595913701). It will benefit both sides: more reviews mean a broader reach on Apple Podcasts and feedback can help me to improve the show and provide better quality content to you. Thank you for doing this üôè
