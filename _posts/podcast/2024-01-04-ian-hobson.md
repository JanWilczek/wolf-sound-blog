## Introduction

For this podcast episode, I was lucky to interview Ian Hobson: a former DJ who transitioned to audio programming, worked at Ableton, and then launched a successful freelancing career.

Ian is well-known in the community for his talks on Rust at the Audio Developer Conferences and on YouTube. He‚Äôs also created his own programming language: Koto.

We met at the Audio Developer Conference 2022 and he was kind enough to agree on recording an interview with him. I must say that after recording the podcast, I respect his drive to continuously learn and improve even more!

Ian shares a ton of useful knowledge on

* freelancing,
* Rust for audio programming,
* learning Rust,
* self-organization,
* learning DSP,
* maintaining the internal drive in the professional career,
* and more!

I highly encourage you to listen to the podcast in full!
