In this episode, I was fortunate to interview Dr Tom McKenzie, a researcher in the field of spatial audio and acoustics and a musician, who is currently working at the University of Edinburgh as a lecturer in Acoustics and Architectural Acoustics.

At the time of the interview (November 2021), Tom was a postdoctoral researcher at the Aalto Acoustics Lab at the Aalto University in Finland.

He was the last member of the lab interviewed by me. Previous interviews included:

- [Leonardo Fierro]({% post_url podcast/2021-11-19-leonardo-fierro %}),
- [Jon Fagerström]({% post_url podcast/2021-12-17-jon-fagerstrom %}), and
- [Alec Wright]({% post_url podcast/2022-01-29-alec-wright %}).

Please, if you are enjoying the podcast, leave it a review on [Apple Podcasts.](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/wolftalk-podcast-about-audio-programming-people-careers/id1595913701)

Many thanks to Aalto Acoustics Lab for letting us record this interview in their office.
