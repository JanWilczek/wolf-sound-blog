In this podcast episode, I had the privilege to interview Moritz Schaller: a professional musician who turned programmer and successfully transitioned into a software engineering position.

Moritz is a colleague of mine from Loudly GmbH. Not only is he a skilled and smart programmer but also a great person who is extremely likeable.

I am sure that if you are considering a change in your career paths, Moritz’s story and tips will provide you with inspiration and guidance on how to do this.
