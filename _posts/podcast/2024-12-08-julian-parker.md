## Introduction

When I was doing my master‚Äôs at the University of Erlangen-N√ºrnberg, I was eager to learn the internals of the audio programming industry. My supervisor and mentor back then, Maximilian Sch√§fer, PhD, introduced me to **Julian Parker**, PhD, who was working at Native Instruments (NI) in Berlin at the time (this was before Native Instruments merged with iZotope and a few other audio brands).

Thanks to Julian, I learned the behind-the-scenes of the audio plugin development scene in a few eye-to-eye conversations, which we are happy to summarize publicly in a podcast episode!

Julian‚Äôs career is incredible: from natural sciences through a master‚Äôs in physical modeling, a PhD in virtual analog modeling, an almost decade-long position at Native Instruments, all the way to TikTok and Stability AI, where he‚Äôs working now on generative music algorithms.

There are few people who have such a rich background in audio research and industry and even fewer who are willing to share the details of it publicly. That makes this episode all the more exciting!

*Note:*¬†If you like the podcast so far, please,¬†[go to Apple Podcasts and leave me a review there](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/wolftalk-podcast-about-audio-programming-people-careers/id1595913701). You can¬†[do so on Spotify as well](https://open.spotify.com/show/5xc7EJiH9shG6zdSC5ejyw?si=eb35597e60a54e70). It will benefit both sides: more reviews mean a broader reach on Apple Podcasts and feedback can help me to improve the show and provide better quality content to you.

## Episode contents

From this podcast, you will learn:

- how machine learning forever changed audio plugin design and development
- how big audio plugin companies operate internally
- how to learn C++ for audio programming
- whether you need to have a PhD to work in an R&D department of an audio company
- what is the state of the art in generative music
- how to learn generating music with AI
- how to be able to focus on research papers even if you read them after hours
- how to produce quality research
- how to rest & recharge after intense and focused work

## Julian‚Äôs Tips & Observations For Successful DSP Research & Development

1. Best ideas often come in the moments outside of work (during a walk, a shower, etc.).
2. Published research is a sign of competence.
3. Neural networks are like digital signal processing blocks.
4. To create novel research, learn all the existing approaches and think about what you can do better.
5. All of Julian‚Äôs favorite works are the ones published for free.
6. People like demo videos.
7. If you want to learn generative AI, go out there and start playing with open-source and open-weight models like LLaMA or Stable Audio Open. Run inference, tweak.
8. C++ is still important for DSP & fast ML inference (low-level, high-performance programming).
9. Try to maximize the day-to-day joy from what you‚Äôre doing.
10. If you teach something, you need to learn it very deeply (which is a modus operandi of this blog, by the way).
11. Focus in research comes from interest.
12. If you work on something hard, focus on your work for a short time and relax completely afterward.
13. Writing DSP is a great way to learn a programming language.
14. Steps in VIrtual Analog modeling:
    1. Maths
    2. Coding
    3. Tuning
    4. Optimization
