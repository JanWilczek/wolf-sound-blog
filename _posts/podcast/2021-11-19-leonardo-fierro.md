In this episode, I had the privilege to interview Leonard Fierro, a PhD student at the Aalto Acoustics Lab of the Aalto University in Espoo, Finland.

Leonardo comes from Italy and transitioned from Communications to Audio Signal Processing. He's currently (as of 2021) in his third year of the doctoral studies. His focus is on time-scale modification (as in YouTube's 1.5x or 2x speed buttons) and transients. 

In this episode, we are discussing his background and also what is needed to carry out research in the domain of sound processing.
