## Introduction

Jatin Chowdhury is quite well known in the audio programming community for his numerous contributions:

- various open- and closed-source audio plugins,
- a few published research papers on Virtual Analog modeling,
- a few audio-related talks, especially at the Audio Developer Conference,
- insightful Medium articles on creating audio software in general,
- significant open-source contributions including the CLAP plugin standard and Surge Synthesizer.

The list could go on on and on but you get the point: he‚Äôs both incredibly productive and highly successful while being very generous to the community with his knowledge.

That's why it was amazing to have him on the podcast!

Jatin currently leads his own audio plugin company ChowDSP which provides consulting and contracting as well.

During the podcast we discuss his story (which is a kind of ‚Äúfrom hero to superhero‚Äù tale, if you ask me‚Ä¶), what he learnt along the way, all his current strategies, and most importantly: **how you can become someone like a Jatin, a successful audio plugin developer and freelancer**.

I was incredibly inspired during the recording of this episode and revisiting it brought up those feelings again.

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING** ‚ö†Ô∏è Listening to this podcast episode will leave you highly motivated to do more audio programming. Listen at your own risk.

*Note:*¬†If you like the podcast so far, please,¬†[go to Apple Podcasts and leave me a review there](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/wolftalk-podcast-about-audio-programming-people-careers/id1595913701). You can¬†[do so on Spotify as well](https://open.spotify.com/show/5xc7EJiH9shG6zdSC5ejyw?si=eb35597e60a54e70). It will benefit both sides: more reviews mean a broader reach on Apple Podcasts and feedback can help me to improve the show and provide better quality content to you.

## Jatin‚Äôs tips on succeeding in audio plugin development

1. Do open-source plugins to advertise your work.
2. Talk to open-source project developers before contributing to understand the issues you are trying to solve and which approaches have failed to solve it.
3. Start with the basics, low-level understanding.
4. Ask for timbre examples from clients to get an understanding of the sound that they‚Äôre after for a particular plugin.
5. Prototype: start with the DSP part of the plugin.
6. Bottom-up approach to coding a plugin is good for experimentation
7. Be patient with yourself if you don‚Äôt understand something. Put it aside for a while and give it time.
8. Learn the open-source project before contributing.
9. Think of code in an artful way.
10. Never be satisfied. Always become better.
11. How to get the energy for audio programming: be passionate about it. Find something you‚Äôre excited about and that feels fulfilling.
12. Communicate clearly, honestly, and positively with clients.
13. If you figure things out for yourself, it‚Äôs a different level of understanding than if someone explained it to you.
