## Introduction

Geraint Luff is a seasoned audio
DSP developer and the founder of Signalsmith Audio. Geraint‚Äôs presentations, such as ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Write a Reverb‚Äù and ‚ÄúFour
Ways to Write a Pitch Shifter,‚Äù are among the most popular talks at the Audio Developer Conference (ADC) thanks to Geraint's clarity of explanation and easy-to-understand visuals (not to mention the accompanying open-source repos).

In the interview, Geraint shares his insights on his career path, freelancing in the audio industry, and digital signal processing (DSP).
He discusses how he gained traction as a freelancer by joining a community, delivering audio-focused technical talks, and sharing open-source repos. We can also learn his approach to learning DSP, problem-solving, and the significance of
visualization in explanations.

## Tips from Geraint on Learning DSP

1. A top-down approach can make learning DSP more accessible. Start hands-on and develop an understanding of the
   underlying principles, reaching the equations as needed.
2. Setting small, achievable goals and rewarding yourself at each stage can help you stay motivated.
3. Teaching reinforces your understanding and helps identify knowledge gaps.
4. Explore Web UIs for DSP tools. Accessible, browser-based interfaces powered by web technologies are becoming
   increasingly popular and make it easy to showcase your work to clients.
5. Use automated tests to validate basic DSP blocks, which gives you confidence in your implementations.
6. Finding a supportive community to help you when you get stuck is invaluable.
7. Don‚Äôt undervalue your skills as a freelancer. Whether you‚Äôre starting out or experienced, your time, skills, and
   knowledge have value.
