## Introduction

Dave Rowland is the CTO of Audio Squadron: a group of audio-related companies. More specifically, he's the architect and the lead developer of the Waveform digital audio workstation (DAW) and an Audio Manager of Prism Sound (which focuses on audio hardware manufacturing). He's also a very successful speaker, having given talks at conferences like Audio Developer Conference or C++ on Sea.

Given the popularity of Dave's talks and his 11-year long (as of 2024) experience in developing the Waveform DAW and its open source engine, I am incredibly excited to have him on the WolfTalk podcast.

During the interview, we learn not only Dave's story but we also discuss the challenges of building real-time audio software including DAWs and learning C++, software architecture, and high-performance real-time programming concerning audio. Dave shares a ton of highly useful tips and resources so you don't want to miss out on this one!

## Episode contents

From this podcast episode, you will learn:

* how Dave organizes his day for maximum productivity,
* which tools he's leveraging on the day-to-day basis,
* how he went from being a music technology student to a freelance audio developer to the lead developer on the Tracktion DAW (now Waveform),
* how he approaches creating his widely acclaimed conference talks,
* which resources to use to learn high-performance real-time programming.

This podcast was recorded on March 25, 2024.

## Dave‚Äôs tips on being a good audio programmer

1. If you want to learn something, teach it.
2. Have good test coverage and benchmarks.
3. Write down the requirements (for the project you‚Äôre working on).
4. Write tests.
5. Give talks.
6. Approach programming as problem solving.
7. Use tools available to you.
8. Talk to other programmers.
9. Real-time programming is hard because it cannot be tested; RADSan (Realtime-Safety Sanitizer) may help in that.
10. Try NOT to do stuff to optimize; use a profiler.
