## Introduction

In this podcast episode, I was lucky to interview Christoph Guttandin: a web audio developer from Berlin, Germany.

Chris is a self-taught programmer with a formal training as an audio-visual technician. He's a freelancer who deals with playing back sound in the browser, sometimes on multiple computers simultaneously. He's a member of the W3C Audio Community Group where he gives feedback regarding the new standards. He's especially careful about the compliance of browsers to standard updates. He regularly answers questions regarding web audio on StackOverflow. He was a speaker at the Audio Developer Conference 2022.

In the podcast, we not only discuss his background and his story of how he became a web audio developer but we also uncover how you can become one. I specifically ask him about the best resources on web audio programming and which languages, tools & frameworks to use.

*Note:*¬†If you like the podcast so far, please,¬†[go to Apple Podcasts and leave me a review there](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/wolftalk-podcast-about-audio-programming-people-careers/id1595913701). It will benefit both sides: more reviews mean a broader reach on Apple Podcasts and feedback can help me to improve the show and provide better quality content to you. Thank you for doing this üôè
