On this blog we are dealing with the topic of audio programming. But what is it actually?

**Programming** is the art of writing programs to be run on machines. **Audio** here means the sound in general. So audio programming is writing software that is concerned with sound.

There are many purposes of audio programming:

  * Synthesis: whether of music or speech, a lot of audio software is written to generate some sort of audible output solely from the input parameters.
  * Coding: encoding to a certain format or form and decoding from it to the original (or nearly original) value. For example, that is where MP3 codec comes into play.
  * Enhancement: very often the aim of the program is to reduce noise, increase intelligibility etc. of music or speech recordings. An important area of development is the hearing-aid industry.
  * Post-processing & data analysis: multiple algorithms have been developed that use microphone data in a variety of ways. Separating speakers from mixture recordings or health monitoring are two examples. Automatic speech recognition algorithms should also be mentioned here.
  * Effects: sound effects make up a big set of algorithms used in both hardware (digital stage effects) and software (audio plug-ins in Digital Audio Workstations).
  * Computer games: immersive sound plays a key role in computer games. With the development of Virtual Reality a lot of pressure has been put on the feeling of realistic propagation of sound in virtual space.
  * Simulation: code may be written to establish the acoustic characteristics of a room or a material.
  * Equipment management: studio and measurement equipment needs software to run, so-called drivers. This area is particularly difficult for beginners, since drivers need to be fast, compact and reliable in every possible situation.
  * Streaming: efficient network algorithms are used in many of the streaming platforms like Spotify, Tidal or iTunes.

The knowledge basis for audio programming consists of:

  * programming (programming language, software design, application architecture)
  * digital signal processing (DSP)
  * acoustics (sound as a physical phenomenon)
  * physiology and psychology of hearing
  * music theory
  * probablity theory and stochastic processes
  * mathematics

To really master the audio programming skill, to be able to &#8220;code sound&#8221; you need to get a good grasp of the above. And that&#8217;s what WolfSound is all about!
