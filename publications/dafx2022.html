<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Recent research in deep learning has shown that neural networks
    are capable of learning the derivative of a dynamical system. In
    this paper, we adapt this concept to Virtual Analog (VA) modeling
    to learn the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) governing the
    first-order and the second-order diode clipper. The proposed models achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) albeit using fewer parameters. We show
    that this approach does not require oversampling and allows to increase the sampling rate after the training has completed, what results in increased accuracy. Using a sophisticated numerical solver
    allows to increase the accuracy at the cost of slower processing.
    ODEs learned this way do not require closed forms but are still
    physically interpretable.
