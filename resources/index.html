<article>
    <p>
        Here are my recommended resources for mastering audio programming (and some other areas of life). All the
        products on this page were thoroughly tested by me, and I found them <strong>incredibly</strong> useful.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before we dive into it, let me just say that if you truly want to learn audio programming, the best way I know to do it is to <a href="{% link collections.all, 'newsletter.md' %}" target="_blank">subscribe to my newsletter</a>. In this way, you'll have regular and instant access to the most valuable materials on audio programming fundamentals and advanced techniques.
    </p>

    <p>
        With this out of the way, I need to stress 2 points about this list:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>This is my personal "top" list.</strong> I haven't read all the books that exist on audio programming, therefore I cannot say that these are the best books overall. They are the best books I know personally.</li>
        <li><strong>This is my personal "top" list.</strong> ðŸ˜‰ If you disagree with my opinion, then please, share it in the comments below! Other readers will benefit from a diversity of opinions.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Where possible, I have included links to legal, free versions of the mentioned books.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have any questions to these resources, feel free to ask a comment in the comment section at the bottom of
        the page.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, if you benefited from these products yourself, please, let everyone know as well!
