Welcome to the WolfSound! Thank You for being here.

My name is Jan Wilczek and I have created WolfSound to be able to share my passion of audio programming. If you want to know my story, I described it thoroughly in [the first episode of the WolfTalk podcast]({% post_url collections.posts, podcast/2021-10-29-how-i-got-started-with-audio-programming %}).

On WolfSound you can expect three types of activity (the &#8216;pillars&#8217; of the brand):

* **Knowledge:** videos, articles, courses, books, podcasts etc. concerning the topic of sound programming. My primal area of interests are sound synthesis and music effects programming, but the topics will cover a much wider ground (although always connected to sound, or programming, or both). I want to share my knowledge, but I also want to learn from You-Your suggestions and tips are always welcomed! The following areas are considered significant:
  * sound synthesis
  * sound effects (e.g. filters, reverb, compression)
  * digital signal processing (DSP)
  * algorithmic composition
  * music processing
  * sound application programming interfaces (APIs)
  * different programming languages and their application to audio processing
  * listening conditions
  * computer games audio
  * human hearing
* **Products:** I am developing my own sound synthesisers for commercial release, but there are other projects on the horizon, so definitely stick around for some Digital Audio Workstation plug-ins and more!
* **Services:** consulting, leading seminars, carrying out audio programming tasks on demand; all for the greater good of audio!
